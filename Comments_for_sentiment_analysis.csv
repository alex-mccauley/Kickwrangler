Any kind of math operation to spawn additional waveforms is also done in SW.

79,114,"Melissa We put a lot of thought into the bike theft issue when we designed Spark. Currently, there are no proven methods to stopping thieves if they want something bad enough, theyll find a way. However, here are some of the stuff we did to improve Sparks antitheft features 1. LCD screen  Battery are both removable so the rider can take it with them when they lock up Spark. 2. The seat also has a quick release so the rider can take it as well. A bike with no seat has been proven to deter theft more than a bike with a seat intact. 3. The tires are NOT quick release. The only way for a thief to steal your tire is with the aid of a tool.

81,53,"I come from a long career in data processing before it was called IT in the financial services industry. In my early years I programmed in six different languages and after getting into management I enjoyed using a TRS80 and IBM PC to write BASIC programs just for fun. There was always something special to me about a computer that would just boot up ready to use BASIC. And that is what Chuck Hellebuyck makes available to everyone again with this project a small, selfcontained, and ready to use i.e. no soldering computer that runs the MMBASIC interpreter which is very close to Microsoft BASIC GWBASIC that ran on my TRS80. IMO, the BASIC programming language, unlike the C language variants, uses a strait forward syntax that is easy to work with and is a great way to learn programming. It should also be noted that the Maximite board design interfaces with Arduino shields so it can be used to learn about this common microcontroller platform that is used in robotics and to drive 3D printers. I hope my comments help you decide to back this project to meet its goal and much more so we all have access to a dedicated BASIC computer again.",81023186

144,8,Thanks for the sticker and for all the work so far.,148069053
145,3,"QuestionsSuggestions 1. Amazon  I believe that like many products that claim to be great which being optimistic I believe yours will be it really isnt known for sure until you check the Amazon reviews. Do you plan on setting up shop like many other KS creators and using that as a platform to market this as well as future products and accessories to the masses because again assuming all goes well with this Ill be sure to write a review. Also considering US backers use Amazon to checkout on KS thus indicating they have an account, establishing yourself there would be a good idea, no Another reason is because as Im sure like other backers so many products nowadays want us to sign up for another site that avoiding to have to remember another username and password would be greatly appreciated. 2. Official Return Policy andor Warranty Manufacturers or otherwise  Could you specify in detail exactly what your warranty covers and what it does not as well as outline your return policy if any also going into detail of the processes involved in both cases ex we pay for shipping back or you do etc..., thanks. 3. Material  So this is made out of what material exactly and please dont say metal, a detailed a response as possible is ideal even where sourced from would be helpful. ATTRACT BACKERS 4. Early Bird adopter Specials  KS backers kill for them, and depending on what your budget would allow for because then if done even better some campaigns introduce or actually start with Super Early Bird offers than Early than Midday KS offer below retail. Some add names unique to their own campaign, such as early thiefs idk seeing how their getting in before the you get the idea. FILL YOUR PAGE 5. Stretch Goals  Too late now of course but for future projects Id recommend featuring accolades as well as stretch goals more prominently so as to let potential backers know how well you are already doing andor with plans on a improved product or benefits to compel them to jump on board despite some of the better perks being eaten up already. Ex This project is Dragon Certified which no doubt not for this project but for next perhaps assuming this is successful andor featured in articles on Engadget for example. Considering you dont have the accolades featured obviously Id consider especially since being closer to the finish line placing greater emphasis on the stretch goals. KEEP BACKERS 6. Updates  Will you continue to update your backers updates on current projects, future projects, others questions answered etc through KS comment section, update section, direct message andor email after campaign ends KS is ideal 7. ContactSupport  What are the different ways to contact you after the campaign ends Aside from a website In case of problems etc, it would be in your interest to keep communicating on KS not only with direct messages but comment section questions so that the community can see perhaps answers to questions they hadnt even thought of. Some companies have a number andor email as well. ATTRACT BACKERS 8. Sister Campaign  I suggest trying if you havent already to contact other projects with a similar focus to ultimately create a sister campaign with as others such as Yoropen has done with swivelCard as one example to try garner support from an additional channel though this being so late probably wont be for this campaign but next maybe. 9. Security  Is this device tamper proof from the outside or are their ways a would be thief with time could eliminate the purpose of this device or is it relatively unless they break the door solid in its concept ATTRACT BACKERS 10. ThunderClap  I believe this is a tool LinkMount By the way that is the perfect example of what a Kickstarter campaign is in almost every aspect so study it among others have used to garner support so please research it as well if you havent so you could use it to help. 11. IndieGoGo  I would recommend you be open if you will or have ever operated on another crowdfunding site because if found out many will begin to distrust you not mentioning earlier especially if no good answer is provided why you are relaunching here. 12. Future Discount  For your backers relative to other kickstarter projects some creators like those of the Blink campaign as just one example have made their backers if not generally which Id recommend at least for Earlybirds aware that they would have continued access to special promotions and discounts following the campaignwill you be offering anything similar for yours Like for your future projects like they have such as your v2 if you make one and accessories Also for upcoming releases will you also be contacting us early as well to put us on notice 13. Listing Image Update  Another GREAT way to further inform potential backers of info that might entice them to want to click on your listing such as other successful creators have done and you may have seen is update your main image with custom complimentary text updates within the main picture in addition to your already Staff pick add Listing ending in 3 days or 2 hours left or New stretch goals added or achievedunlocked or 85 accomlished or Earlybird offers dwindling or Additional Early bird offers now offered etcTrust me that will help. 14. Faulty Lock  How would you know if your device is faulty or defective in some way What signs to look out for other than clearly broken in pieces, loose parts noises etc 15. Privacy Policy and Backers Information  What exactly will you be doing with backers information Ex Giving it to 3rd parties or protecting it from them etc Also what is your privacy policy. 16. AddOns and Accessories  A carry bag for travel again that would be an idea for a stretch goal not now since your finished 17. Maintenance  Regarding proper care to maintain the ring for longevity, what would be recommended Special sprays, cleaners, updates, equipment in the form of tools, etcthose to use and avoid would be helpful I appreciate you taking the time to read all of these if you could and await your replies. This hopefully should help you.",149890531

I would love to see when checklists and more features are available like custom categories morning specific tasks, night tasks. Also when choosing how a taskhabit repeats itself Like setting the specific time of the day it may have to be completed by. Or inversely, that it must be complete or not complete, ie quitting cigarettes within a certain amount of days, weeks, or months a certain amount times it may have to be completed in that time frame. In my opinion, these kinds of features would effectively replace the necessity to use most of the other 3rd party apps. I think the only other app I would use is Google Calender, which I wish I can set up with he Habits section mobile app functionality can use location base to detect if I followed the weekday work habit, and once I check in at work can do worklocation based todos or homebased todos at home etc... and if Google Tasks eventually syncs with HabitRPGs Todos. drool",197254176

190,51,"Wishing all of you a Happy Thanksgiving Holiday Weekend! Robert  short answer is yes  Sofft works very well with dress shirts in terms of ironing and providing a professional finish. The process we used to obtain the professional finish is detailed below. We washed dress shirts using a liquid detergent, introduced starch in the rinse cycle of a front loading washing machine and then immersed the clean clothes in diluted Sofft for 10 minutes in a 5 gallon pail. The cleaners have programmable washing machines so that they can inject starch and Sofft sequentially into the washing machines.The shirts were then put back in the washer in the spindry cycle, dried and then ironed. After treating the clothes with Sofft, the ironing process is remarkably easier and it is also easier to obtain a more professional quality finish on dress shirts at home. Incidentally, this experiment was done with my friend who had his own dry cleaning shop for over 20 years. He was so impressed that he signed on to recruit his dry cleaner colleagues to offer Sofft treated shirts to their clients. When we do our laundry at home, there is not a straightforward way to introduce both starch and Sofft into the washing machine at this time on front loading washing machines. Please let us know how you plan to use Sofft to treat your dress shirts.",208457577

However, Tony being the practical one, informed me that we had to run 1,000 of whatever color we chose and choosing more than one was financially out of the question. Of course I was disappointed, but put my business hat on and sat down to tally all the votes, private messages and comments. I thought that the color should be a commemoration of the Kick Starter nature of our companys launch and a special reminder for all our gracious backers of your role in a successful Kick Starter project. Soo.... drum roll please The special KickStarter color will be KICK STARTER GREEN I hope that I havent disappointed too many of you and I fought hard for adding two colors. I promise it wont be an obnoxious green. It is a fun green. So, I will be sending out your surveys to select Black, White or Kick Starter Green Expedition Only later this morning. Tony leaves for China in 16 hours so we hope we have a good idea of the mix of color choices by the time he lands. Again, Thank you so much for all your support! Christina Vilgiate",244028708

330,321,James We will post to the FAQwebsite detailed post finishing instructions soon but resin handling is similar to other resins commercially available. Resins have zero VOC and minimal odor. We have taken great care to make it as safe as possible and will post a detailed MSDS soon after the campaign. You should wear gloves like handling any other common household chemicals. After printing you need to wash it to remove uncured resin. Rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol or Tripropylene Glycol Methyl Ether TPM are ok. TPM is preferred since it swells less and has less VOCsmell than rubbing alcohol but is harder to obtain. Material properties are similar to ABS and we will perform a detailed analysis by soon. The resin is carefully formulated to keep fine details while still being strong and not brittle to avoid cracking. It has enough flexibility that you can bend the staff in the red poseidon statue without breaking it not as brittle as say acrylic. The printed hollows spheres bounce without cracking. Ryan The Pegasus traces a laser in vector mode at 3000mmsec over the outlines so the speed of each layer depends on how many outlines it has. Takes around 5hrs to print an 8 Eiffel tower. Quality is very important to us so be sure to examine the details of our prints to be comparing apples to apples. We would never say anything about another product without having first hand experience so cant comment on the other printer.,347865310

After signing onto this project last night I was thinking about the president of our local AMA RC flying club who unfortunately suffered a stroke recently and will probably not ever have much use of his left arm. We here have been particularly sad about that because hes been building and flying wonderful models since the 1930s. Well, I realized that what with iPhly being a onehand controller, maybe hes not done flying yet! Which leads to the idea that iPhly will make it possible for all sorts of people who have temporarily or permanently lost the use of a hand or arm to engage in RC activities. I dont recall seeing any other onehand controllers, and I think this might be a rather important application.

394,21,"Got my GLion a couple of weeks ago. Observations in no particular order 1 This is my second electric scooter, my first one is a MyWay. Since the MyWay cost me 1800, I wont make a direct 11 comparison. I will, however, use it as a reference. 2 The GLion is lighter than the MyWay, by about 5 kilos I would say. 3 Theyre both pretty simple with the folding  unfolding. 4 GLion could use more shock absorption  I literally rattle my teeth when going over any slight bump or dip. I understand the design idea behind using honeycombed tires rather than air, but an air tires option would provide at least some additional shock absorption. 5 The dimensions of the GLion make it easier to carry around than the MyWay. 6 I wish the GLion charging port was XLR instead of what it shipped with. I could have used the same charger for both scooters leave one at work, another at home. 7 I dont use the USB port. And on the one time I thought about using it, its location pretty much nixed the idea. 8 I dont recall if this was in the manual, but the brakes do NOT work when the motor is off. The MyWay has traditional brakes, front and rear. 9 Theres no rear reflector on the GLion, bit of an oversight imho. The MyWay has two. 10 Doesnt look like theres a secure way to lock up the GLion. 11 Possibly add some way to lock the handlebar into position when folded  this would make it easier to pull the folded scooter behind you a la roller luggage. Right now the handlebar freely moves so theres no way to keep the wheel straight when pulling. 12 Re brakes again  I find the handlebar twisttobrake system rather awkward, especially if youre a righty. Is there any way to incorporate both accel and braking into the right handlebar Would also facilitate oneortheother action. As in, if youre braking, you have to necessarily let go of the throttle. Or something similar. 13 Need a hook or mount or somesuch to hang a shopping bag on. Either on either side of the handlebar post or the front  rear of the post. 14 How much of a technical challenge would it be to have a smallish LED headlight embedded in the handlebar post Closer to the ground than the top This would work as both a daytime running light and convenient night time headlamp. It turns on when the motor is on. 15 Going back to the it only brakes when the motor is on  can a secondary braking system be added One that doesnt require the motor to be on I can foresee an unfortunate scenario wherein your juice runs out JUST as you need to brake. Not something Id like to happen to me. 16 Can the braking be regenerative Seems a waste of braking energy otherwise. 17 How much more expensive would an allaluminum frame version be 18 Carbon fibre model or parts options ",413104742

As the months go on, theyll be understanding more and more of the harder apps and hopefully revisiting some of the harder apps of their first months. But, youre definitely right it WILL be necessary to create some kind of a Level 2 box to which kids can graduate when theyre ready.

It also has a USB port for initially setting up the WiFi connection and for powering the device. We just werent counting on people using the base version for any custom work. I guess you could access the base version via the REST web service interface to get basic sensor data and alarms. Once again we werent planning on documenting that. The base version does not have the raspberry pi so it does not run apache, it does have an httpd server but with limited memory and computing power. Most of the dashboard code is in javascript and JQuery libraries and can be server from our web site, so the internal httpd server on the base version is just sending the page framework and the data stream. Why dont you tell me what you have in mind to do. Maybe I can be more specific then.

It uses the app install name to let any Android phone to install it or be redirected to the Google Play store install page. Im not familiar with the Circle app and how the bitcoin payments operate. The other option you have is programming the NFC Tag to launch a website that allows users to pay via bitcoin. There are definitely plugins or websites with services that should make this easy to implement. Always glad to see NFC replacing UGLY QR codes. Superior design  user experience will always make them the better choice.,614294427

619,90,"Hi Everyone, Great discussion, I wanted to respond to some of the comments. The Bluetooth is 3.0, rather than Bluetooth low energy BTLE. This was a deliberate design choice! The main reason is that Bluetooth 3.0 supports the serial port profile SPP  your computer mac, pc, etc. just sees it is a serial port, with nothing to install or special interfaces. This is the type of behavior people tend to expect from Arduino, BTW  its basically just a wireless version of the USBtoserial that Arduino has been using for years. The other reason is speed. BT 3.0 his a higher overall data throughput that BTLE, by a fair amount. Since the whole ethos behind what we were doing with the Atto was to bring more processing power to the platform, the BT 3.0 seemed a better match. Okay, the other question thats been going around is the question of flashing by USB. Admittedly, we werent thinking of this as something that people would want, but it indeed seems to be important to some, who just want a wired connection. So, were now working on a breakout that will let you select USB for power  flashing, which will make the board function a little more traditionally. The tricky part is making the USB play nice with the Bluetooth, and keeping things simple and straightforward for the user. So, well be working on this circuit solution and associated board, and keep everyone posted. Thanks again for all the support!  AttoDuino",663167301

But since you guys ARE interested heres brief taste on the latest in iWinks labs for the techminded We have had the circuit upgrade prototyped and working on our breadboards for some time and have now switched over to developing that proof of concept in PCB form. The new boards have already been printed and assembled and we are just awaiting the arrival of some lab equipment to get these suckers programmed, test signal quality, test our algorithms, etc. on that new hardware. This is much more difficult to do on the PCB than on the breadboard. We want to be sure that this design will take us where we need to go before we go running our mouth about it! Of course as soon as we confirm all of these items are where they need to be you can expect an update! And again this is holding back much of manufacturing so it is still hard to estimate our ship date until this happens. We have made progress on manufacturing the EEG sensors but some drawbacks have left us with a great concept which is only halfway implemented at the moment.

Most hardware projects require a lot more money to get going but I decided to give Mr. Lizer and kickstarter the benefit of the doubt. I bet Kickstarter would have a lot more skeptical eyes if they were to label their which of their successful projects failed to deliver in the end, because those numbers are not insignificant. Mr. Lizer should just bite the bullet and tell everyone here the project is dead by posting an update. Others with failed projects have come and done this, and people have been accepting of this.

The noise is mainly caused by the fan and motors. It is inevitable, but we will do the same demo with our Prototype V to check if there is an improvement. Actually, we tried other printers before. We think the noise caused by FLUX is relatively small.  Shawn",810165319

Update on Holiday Shipping December 17 2013 Hi Harald, Thank you so much for supporting us throughout our holiday season launch  we are so excited to get you your SOCCKETs! We are here for you and consider you an invaluable part of our mission. As members of our family, we wanted to share an honest update about our SOCCKET shipment status. In autumn, we placed an order to all of our vendors to supply us with materials to make your SOCCKETs for the holiday season. We paid in full for the materials and waited patiently in our newly set up assembly center in Newburgh, NY. Unfortunately, two of our 9 vendors experienced trouble getting us critical parts of the ball by the expected date  some as late as 3 weeks after our promised date. In addition, we have endured two snowstorms in the past four days, during a time when many deliveries were expected and delayed. The good news is that with the current snow tapering off, we will begin shipping SOCCKETs today. Our entire New York team has relocated to our manufacturing center in Newburgh, NY. We have been working for several days, without sleep, sparing no amount of time, energy or money to ensure that all of you will receive your orders in time for the holidays. All of us are personally building, packing and shipping your product. We are upgrading everyone to the fastest delivery possible, and will even hand deliver product if necessary! We are doing all that we can for you, our valued teammate. We hope that you will continue to be patient with us. Your support and enthusiasm over the past few months has been so valuable. You are the reason we exist. We will update you as soon as we can with further details. Please feel free to email us at anytime with questions and concerns. If we do not respond right away, please know it is only because we are on the floor of our factory, spending every minute of the day making your orders happen! Thank you so much, and Happy Holidays!

I can assure you that we are making great progress with all aspects of the project. I rather talk less and have OwnPhones stand as an exceptional product. I know that you are anxious to know exactly where we are standing, but sharing with our backers everything that is going on in our RD means sharing it with the whole world. We know that at least 4 major companies in our industry backed us up, just to learn more about what we do and how we are doing it. Since we are in the process of applying for 3 additional patents, we are very careful about posting videos and pictures. Please try to be patient and understanding, we are really doing the best that we can. We will try and post more updates, but we are always happy to answer emails  we receive many of them every day and our average response time is less than 24 hours. We will post an update today about the app. Thanks for your feedback and support.",886800648

We are focusing on threat prevention and protection as opposed to user and application management.

Is there any syllabus or training manual that comes with all the rewards tier If not, could you specify which one dont have In physical book or pdfs Manuals, videos and instructables are coming, this is the reason we are asking for Kickstarter money because as you can see we already have the boards finished and ready to ship. 3. Can Make!Sense maxmini works portable or it must always tether to a laptopcomputer Mini clips into your tablet or phone in the microphone jack, so its not tethered to the computer, but rather plugged into the phone or tablet. 4. Is that many Make!Sense boards necessary in Constructionist Bundle How about a tier with the most minimum Make!Sense boards as needed in accompany training manuals with all sensors We can probably arrange to make a special deal for you with fewer boards and more sensors, but right now the Kickstarter Rewards are fixed. 5. Is Make!Sense use proprietary sensors Or, I can use any off the shelf sensors such as those from generic Arduino kits Off the shelf sensors are fine, but my current boards only function with analog sensors resistance, voltage not digital sensors that send coded data in a data stream.

885,53,"While it might be fine with the Kickstarter guidelines I havent read them, I must say that I agree with Paul Dutch. Personally, I dont oppose animal testing or using animals for genuine research, but I just dont think mutilating animals even cockroaches to play with is right, much less encouraging and enabling others to do so! If the funding was to do focused research involving the same technology, Id be fine with that, but this is just turning a live animal into a mutilated cyborg toy for commercial gain. It genuinely makes me feel sick in the stomach, and has very much changed my feelings towards Kickstarter as a whole. I wouldnt be able to sleep if I didnt say something. This isnt science at all. This is the equivalent of removing a flys wings to watch it wander hopelessly in frustration until it eventually dies, only in this case much more bizarre. Reiterating the fact that there is no proven painfear response is the equivalent of saying its ok to rape someone while theyre in a coma because they cant tell you to stop. I do have some respect for Kickstarters rules only because of the many brilliant projects they help fund and as such, I do not at this stage intend to withdraw my pledge I may change my mind, but Im not sure if I can withdraw it anyway. I feel as though the onlypledgerscancomment rule forces us to stand alone and face a wall of opposition when we really do have a lot of support in the wider community I would be surprised if the majority of people are comfortable with this type of product. I have read your page on ethics, which I find dances around the topic by way of either answering questions with statements that equate to it is neither proven nor disproven so therefore we are right or misrepresenting education as research. When I was at high school, in science class we were explicitly taught NOT to experiment on live animals. We performed dissections but this was on pieces of animals which had already been killed for other purposes meat. As somebody taught by the Australian public education system, I am deeply disturbed to hear that other institutions do not share these ethical concerns. If there is anything to be learnt from this kind of experimentation, why cant it be learnt once, in a lab, and reproduced only as necessary to validate or build on the results, rather than commercialised as a gimmick If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then where does the road made of aimlessly mutilated animals lead If this is not of ethical concern to Kickstarter, then what is In summary, I dont care what you do on what animals in your own lab, but using a medium like Kickstarter to aid and encourage others in the seemingly pointless mutilation of animals especially in the name of science is simply wrong, and I am completely opposed to this. PS I will also be lodging a complaint with Kickstarter itself. Also, for the record, I hate cockroaches, Im not doing this just for them but for the credibility of Kickstarter and the scientific and education communities, as well as out of fear of what might come next if this project is a success.",944294769

It works with other video and music streaming sites but because of how Hulu uses Flash it is very difficult to control how it connects to the internet through the browser. We are working on a solution for this  but I dont have an estimated delivery time for you right now. If hulu specificly is your primary use you might want to wait until we get that feature working. 2 We will allow video through the servers. 3 Kickstarters will receive unlimited bandwidth as long as they own their SurfEasy key. When we launch the product commercially there will be a service fee tied to bandwidth. We will treat kickstarters the same as post launch customers in terms of bandwidth  no artificial throttling and that type of stuff. Terms and conditions are in the works  if when you get them youre not happy with anything weve done please tell us and if we cant work something out well refund your pledge. thanks Chris",1016549487

154789,4296,"Michael Andrieu Posted this five days ago. It needs to be said again. This is so true. Give us updates. Small ones. Every. Single. Time. They. Happen.  Secondly, STOP THE PRESSES YOU ACTUALLY JUST GAVE US A USEFUL UPDATE This is pertinent information For example the process to add both our thermochromic technology and moisture wicking technology took several months. I worked with several scientists and the factory to accomplish this task. There would be weeks were we literally waited for a new chemical compound to be made from scratch and then shipped to us. Then it took 23 weeks to test these polymers in our fabric. The process itself falls is incorporated in our trade secrets, so what do I tell you guys Then after several different polymer tests we discovered that a machine that could do several steps at different temperatures would be the solution, but this machine needs to be custom fabricated. The machine alone took several months to fabricate, and constant conference calls to accomplish this task. Again, the machine itself allows us to carry out very important steps in our dyeing process. Why in Gods name did you not tell us this before the delays happen Hey just got our new compound in and we are just testing it now. Several weeks later Hey we are done testing the chemical and are now putting it on the shirt Hey, this is all new and we are having delays with it. Instead you just skip your deadlines and claim no reason at all or change your reason. A few weeks ago it was the fullfillment sic center is sorting the shirts it will be out soon, then all of a sudden you miss a deadline no surprise and now it is a legal issue. Why not tell us of the legal issue BEFORE the delay  It is Monday. April 21, 2014. No shirt. No update. Over one year of waiting. I was hoping for a video update.

Its not like they had any sneaky plan to get a flex for less They wanted a prime. Also, Id kind of like to see Christian be at least somewhat successful in this. I suspect that now that he has paid so many fixed costs Kickstarter and Amazon taking their cuts, engineering costs, machining molds for parts, etc., it is actually less expensive to give out a flex than refund.

245152,38,"Hi, first, congrats for the campaign. I really and sincerely cant wait to shape the future of electric skates and Im hardly waiting to ride  But I will never say enough take the time to finish it, I dont care if it takes one month more to do it right. Second, Id like to raise a question  comment about a potential weak point on the monolith the wiring between the battery and manta drives. Given the photosvideos we have at our disposal, it seems the wires are external to the trucks, which means we could eventually replace the truck  but thats not the point. We dont see any photo  video of the mantadrives connectors. Even in the FAQ video, wires are disconnected and no connector obviously show on the mantadrive internal side. So first, how are they connected  But thats even not the point, as long as the job is done. The point is that I fear there are some conditions where these wires could be wrenched, obviously by accident. Say, by pulling out the skate from a full luggage compartment, or most probably hitting a sidewalk edge, or even riding onto a rock the rider didnt see or could not avoid. All my longboard trucks have a noticeable number of grates on their frontside, and the mantadrive wires seem to be exactly at these locations. It could eventually solve the problem if these wires could be easily tearable with connectors on both sides, or autodeengaging like the apple magsafe connector. Im not a hardware engineer but used to work with some for years, and I think there is a point where vibrations wont be strong enough to disengage a magsafelike connector in normal cruising conditions. There may be a connector size problem on the mantadrive side, but obviously not on the deck side, which could solve a small part of the problem if at least one side of the cable was autodeengaging, and the others manually unpluggable. Long story short I prefer a stopping skate that I must reconnect by hand that a dead wire end that I have to resolder by hand  at best  or send back to dealer for a full skate surgery  at worst. Designing a truck which integrates the wires and provides inductionlike transmitters inside the mantadrives seems out of scope for this first version, and Im perfectly OK with that. I think that with a replaceable wire connector it could even be not worth the time designing it. Could you elaborate on this wireandconnectors subject please  And note  as this seems a real engeniering question, I dont expect an answer in the same day, but rather some evidence you have put time on the question, like you obviously did on other sides of the product, when we compare it to competitors. Best regards from a happy backer,",768904058

The social network will let you reach those early adapters and hopefully those same people will reach out to their network of potential oneironauts. Since this lacks REMdetection, I would greatly stress to buyers that the WBTB method is what would work best with a timed delay of stimuli that is most likely to active during REM4 or REM5.

Here is some info sent to the company on July 2, 2014 applicants mark VACHEN is highly similar to the registered mark VACON in sound, appearance and commercial impression. The only differences between the marks are the silent letter H in the middle of applicants mark and the phoneticallyequivalent letters E and O in the marks. However, minor changes in words e.g. phonetic substitution are insufficient alone to distinguish marks.

Kickstarters Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. This is what creators see before they launch. We crafted these terms to create a legal requirement for creators to follow through on their projects, and to give backers a recourse if they dont. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. Can Kickstarter refund the money if a project is unable to fulfill No. Kickstarter doesnt issue refunds as transactions are between backers and creators directly. Creators receive all funds less fees soon after their campaign ends.

243864,1029,"This is my first backing of a kickstarter project as many others. However, I feel I must be frank and state I am not too surprised about Wikibear. In many cases Kickstarterr is a way for people to take their ideas and get the funding to make an actual product. I would assume any product creators goal is to take their project beyond kickstarter and mass produce their product. For many that means they want to take their company to bigger better things and for others it means they sell their ideas to a company that has the infrastructure to mass produce. Based on the creators updates I feel it is obvious that selling the idea was the only option as the process of production has taken much longer than anticipated. The way I read the accountability information is that we are either provided a refund or what we were promised. There is an obvious lack of information here but I wonder if we are being offered the Wikibear because Supertoy does not meet the original goals of the project. I took the cheapest option for a bear so I will choose the option that will have the most complete development and possibility for future updates. I do expect detailed information on both options though before we are expected to make a choice. I also suspect the creator was not allowed to make certain updates to us while a deal was being finalized but I do feel the information that has been given could have been presented in a much better way and more information could have been given. The way I read the update made me feel that Ashley is still bitter about the split and I felt there was a bit of gloating that he still did it by himself. I choose to believe that he never meant to convey those types of emotion since I have felt he is a vey caring man from the updates we have seen but it did leave me upset immediately after reading it for the first time. Ashley, I am very happy that you have been able to take your 3 year old idea to the commercial market finally and I am sure it was so much harder than you anticipated. If you cant divulge certain information due to your deal please just let us know that. A simple statement acknowledging that there were mistakes also goes a long way. I look forward to hearing from you in the next few days.",1278036835

5055,3550,"Amir Cant quite see the absurdity you refer to. Your post states So, Ive set up an IRC chat room where we can talk about strategies such as contacting media, organizing a mass exodus, alternate printers, and anything else that comes to mind. What else are the reasons you list other than aggressive ones It hardly indicates that discourse and reason were your first ports of call. And in answer to your response, you were quite happy to be a leader in setting the chat room up, not sure why you are now stating that your post was only reflecting the views on here why not take a lead in suggesting alternatives Difficult to be a wolf  a sheep at the same time. You are fully entitled to set up a chat room I was commenting on the purpose, not its existence and it is exactly the type of active participation  community development that an environment such as this should be supporting. I think that the opportunity for backers and creators to engage in discussion, share ideas  coproduce projects is one of key factors that sets crowdfunding apart from anything else I have seen. 10 months ago I didnt even know that 3d printing existed. Now I might get two 3d printers by Christmas and the young people I work with will have access to future disruptive technologies that may shape their lives. Through Kickstarter, I have learnt so much and been able to pass on my own knowledge  the things I have seen on here to creators from the US, Asia, South America  Europe. Where else would I be able to do that I guess my point here is that crowdfunding presents a different way of doing things. It disturbs me that things here have changed so quickly from being friendly and accommodating to talk of lawyers  PR campaigns. I have observed a pack mentality on a number of projects that I have backed all technical ones dont know what that tells me, where vitriol  spite replace reason and consideration. I hope that this doesnt descend into that too. As John Good points out, the Friday update was probably a mistake, as it has left a vacuum over the weekend to be filled. So there is a strong argument that they have made their own bed. However do we collectively want to cripple this company without giving them a chance to explain as they have said they will on Sunday exactly what the ramifications of these decisions will be Or whether there might be alternatives to what has initially been proposed. There will undoubtedly be some bright minds on here, who may be able to offer information, advice  guidance that could prove invaluable to Pirate3D. I wonder whether those with relevant knowledge or skills could set up a chat room to think through positive solutions...

Even if you think they started to think of ways of making their hit better which I dont think they are doing, but that is another discussion they should have said from the moment they knew this. That would be in October. Not in February. What do you think that they have been doing in the mean time Just sitting around and smiling because of the huge success In your scenario they should not have play along like nothing changed for months, never mention anything about delays and then at the moment the were supposed to start shipping announce they have changed the entire project. I still think Mozilla is involved in this. At least that is what Matchstick has been saying for some time and no one at Mozilla have said this is not true. So I dont blame Google for Samsung Touchwiz because Samsung never said that Google was helping them write it. Matchstick is claiming that Mozilla is helping them with this project. So Mozilla knew they were going to do this baitandswtich stuff and they should have said we dont want to take part in defrauding people from their money. Or if tMozilla did not know about the baitandswitch they should say now that the were surprised with this as well and from now on wont support this fraudulent company anymore. But since they are silent, I can only assume Im right and Mozilla is OK with defrauding people from their money. I dont think Matchstick had actually said they would support Netflix, at least I couldnt find it anymore. They did have a logo in their project pictures. It still says in the project page theyre talking to several content providers. They had to remove the Netflix logo because the deal was not yet closed and Netflix didnt want people to think the deal was done. This was already known after a few days and at that time you could redraw from the Kickstarter project because the end date for the funding phase had not been reached. So I agree it was not really smart of them to use logos without deals. But nobody would be out of his or her money because everybody could still cancel their support. Now, everybody has paid and I cant click on a button to cancel my backing anymore. I dont think anybody ever asked for a faster processor well, at least not in the comments. So why change the project to change the processor There were several people asking for better Wifi adding 5GH and not just 2.4Ghz, people asking for Bluetooth support and many more. All of these were shot down because the hardware was final. They already made the first batch for the developers! In fact even now they dont say they are adding 5Ghz. Or Bluetooth. Or all the other things people asked for. Like I said before if they want to make a 2.0 version of their stick, I couldnt agree more.

I dont see how anyone could seriously wear this as a sleep monitor. I wear a Fitbit Charge HR 247 and the Flyshark will definitely not get the Charge HR off my wrist. The operating system is not bad and is pretty intuitive. Switching watch faces is simple as others have mentioned. I had to set the date and time 3 times before it took. Only a 24 hour time in digital mode. You have to turn on the pedometer and the sleep functions, but the sleep function screen seems to me to say you have to turn it on before sleep and off upon awakening. Bluetooth pairing was pretty simple and it lets you select BT v3 or 4 which is nice. So far, I havent been able to get it to sync with the Android app. Every time I hit Synchronize it says disconnected whatever that means. So, no notifications have passed from my Note 3 to the Flyshark at all. There is still more I have to learn, but like ryan said, meh. More to come.",1565829631

It looks interesting and at 3000 and 3500 it seems like a good price depending on the battery technology they are using. The backup battery is not that interesting allowing a 10kWh cycle once a week at 3500 but the other one looks more interesting with 7kWh capacity and daily cycle for 3000. What they are not clear about is what sort of daily cycle they allow for that 10 year warranty to be valid. I suppose they use the same battery capacity in both but they limit the daily cycled one to 7kWh to prolong the battery life but then not sure why is 500 less. They probably have around 107 cells in series and around 7 in parallel if they use the same 18650 cells they use in the Tesla. 3.1Ah x 4.2V x 107 x 7  9752kWh close to that 10kWh backup pack. The price looks realy good but considering the volume they will sell this and all they have is the cells and BMS and all represent about 10 of the battery pack in Tesla it seems the right price. Still curios about more details especially about the warranty and what will that cover. Im sure they will have a energy counter and they will have a limit on the amount of energy covered in warranty. That number will be extremely important and I hope it will be released sun since it made me curios  Dacian.",719724525

364458,760,"Its natural to wish for dramatic closeup shots. But lets keep in mind the realworld limitations of any drone. Even if we assume that the electronic parts of the system have zero lag which is almost certainly not the case, the drone itself has inertia. Its a threepound flying object that cant change direction instantaneously. It takes a finite amount of time to alter the rotors rate of spin they have inertia too!, and still more time for the drone itself to tilt and begin to move in a new direction. Now lets suppose you are that motorcyclist in the video, and the AirDog is following you at five feet altitude and three feet away horizontally. You could easily swerve into the rotors before the drone could respond and move away... or a gust of wind could push the drone off its path in your direction. At best, you could end up with an unwanted haircut. At worst, serious facial lacerations could result. Ill say it again before launching any large flying object, we need to be thinking What could go wrong with this flight, and how can I avoid it AirDogs autofollowing technology is a wonderful accomplishment, but it isnt magic and it isnt idiotproof.",1349915702

A considerably less complex project  GStick Mouse  is OVER 14 months late, and not even near completion with a project team that are completely unresponsive or interested in backers beyond taking the money.

437793,28,"I agree with Anthony. This seems needless aside from being elementary school fair, as was the basic gist of the given reason for the windows version delay. Im wondering... a single license of Hitfilm 2 Ult allows 3 concurrent installations. Does this mean I can use the same license to install on a combination of Mac and Windows machines for a total of 3 machines Or, will we have to choose between windows and Mac versions If not the latter, is it the logistics of delivering two versions under one serial that is the actual reason for the Windows version delay I could understand more than Its not fair. Or, is it that the version we get now wouldnt have our names on a special screen, which is something I can get over REALLY quickly. In fact, Im already over it....  I bet there is a LARGE contingent of folks here who pledged because they could get the Windows version at a reduced cost. I also bet that this contributed greatly to the the Mac users even getting a Mac version at all, i.e. the success of the Kickstarter. please dont take this wrong. Im not trying to start a holy war here P The only reason I can imagine this being bad for the Windows users is if we got Windows version 2.x now, and version 2.x was shipped with the Mac version in November and we were stuck with 2.0x. Provided the Mac version ships in November. Would Mac users really feel betrayed if the windows users were allowed to have their serials now Would this cause a licensing nightmare for Hitfilm How many Mac users plan to install on both Mac AND Windows, and could use the Windows version now",397345909

434114,880,"Theres no fault, really. The cabinet, or who signed on because of it has nothing to do with development time. Things take time for a variety of reasons. Design changes, improvements, supplier delays all play a part. It is true that some people characterize participation in this project as merely a transaction for goods or services, which it decidedly is not. What most realize is that this is not a transaction. Its a group effort to visualize, support and execute on something that didnt exist previously. Although the cab is a part of the project, it is a secondary part, and the main part has to take precedence because it is more work and requires more persistence. The cabinets speaker and electronics are done. Weve selected a supplier to build the actual cabinetry although they are not a large outfit and are a bit backed up, which is fine actually. The minute we decide we need them to step up and be ready for model launch, they will be there. What about the transformer Heres the thing. We considered not even mentioning it because you guys dont really know what goes into transformer design and by discussing it, we open ourselves up to a lot of irrelevant questions. But we decided to talk about it for the very reason we did this as a KS project. Everybody has a vested interest in the project, so you might as well participate in the arcana, however grey such information may seem at times. Truth is, it took going through 3 suppliers to find the right partner for this particular part. We routinely deal with several transformer suppliers, and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. Our first choice of suppliers went AWOL on us early in the project. We could not get phone calls or emails answered after a week or so of initial conversations. After going to two other suppliers and getting unsatisfactory results we went back to the original party and tried to resurrect the communication. We basically told them that we wanted to know why they went quiet on us. Turns out, they somehow got the idea we were using their design engineering team to develop a prototype that we were going to have made offshore. So now, they have been reassured that they are the supplier we want on the project and they have provided the best proposal for the project. All that remains now is to test their sample which is slated to arrive this week. And FYI, a big part of the transformer design is that we dont want to increase the proposed product size unless we absolutely have to. It may seem like a silly challenge to some. After all, whats a half an inch here and there Simple answer A lot! We believe we can do it the way we originally intended and thats really the goal isnt it This is a project with a goal  several, actually, but mainly to accomplish what we set out to accomplish",882981503

June 11, 2012. PPS Blogger httpwww.appsblogger.comkickstarterinfographic Interesting infographic around successes and failures. I personally think Kickstarter is a great crowdsourcing site and fills a necessary void, helping entrepreneurs to reach their dreams and aspirations. But that does not mean there are not challenges as there certainly are and I also believe as a young company Kickstarter that some of the issues brought up will be addressed going forward as it is difficult to have hindsight. I learned a lot from the above readings and more clearly understand the issues that not only Kickstarter faces but also what to look for when investing in projects. I wish Kickstarter well as they are needed avenue for aspiring entrepreneurs.",1806697040

288419,2769,"I love the idea of the game stick. Ive even defended play jam on their game stick Facebook page. But at this point.... Theyve lost all respect as a company that they ever could have earned. I live paycheck to paycheck, and dedicated money that could have been spent on more important things to find this product. I even went out of my way to get friends to fund this. Now I am embarrassed that I ever trusted these people. They havent shown this product in mass production yet, but they are able to record razrsp products on the lines. All try showed us was ONE unit being tested and a mold. At this point it seems like a scam. They spent a couple thousand to make some molds and have a good time touring factories in china, but not a single person in their entire staff has contacted anyone outside the company regarding this product In almost over a month.

193427,8,"bill, I cant tell if you are being serious. Your allegations are kind of silly. If the idea was viable and he needed vc then breaking promises and poor communication is not an excuse. Of course people will start complaining. As you noticed more people became more and more negative as time went on, why broken promises a video of a shot being pulled, and interiors... Then all of a sudden that machine disappeared. I was very positive at the start, I didnt listen to the naysayers... As I said before it wasnt what others said that makes me believe and say what I do, its the leadership at the top and what their actions and words have saiddone. Blame always goes to the top, if something fails it always falls on leadership. Being honest, laying out problems from the start, not lying... Thats how you keep people on your side. Most kickstarters deliver late. People dont get as pissed off as they have here. Why Because the creators stay honest, they say whats working what isnt. They engage the backers. They problem solve. None of these have been the way these creators have carried themselves on here. Maybe if they open up, stop being so secretive, invest their own money, and communicate more they may buy themselves some good grace. But attacking and ignoring backers is never the way to do that. In the end it may be 300 dollars gone. Dealing with dying people everyday, I have come to realize that there is much more important things then money. However, I am a man of my word, I believe in honor, so to feel as if I have been lied to, and been taken advantage of doesnt feel good. I will live to see another day, to help another human. Life is too precious. Good night all. sweet dreams.",650012718

347205,346,"Hello, i got some thoughs for you, maybe you could implement them 1. Even you got the propeller savers installed, do you think it would be possible to add a small horizontal ring or at last and halfring to the outside to the unit It could be removeable and just to protect the propellers from hitting anything. You could place it on the flexible ring wich holds the gears of the wheel. Not serious but as you mentioned the water landing 2. Why not make it 100 waterproof and add a small propeller so it could swim in water I think the wheels could be used as rudder and with maybe with a bigger profile they could even be used to drive inside the water! D 3. I really like the idea of a adjustable camera but why not add a second camera to the bottom and giving the user the ability to switch them while recording And if my idea 2 would be implemented, i think the bottom camera could be waterproofed more easily then offering an adjustable camera. 4. If the B can support a GoPro cam mounted on top, could you offer an easy way to mount it E.g. with a replace able top cover Would also be willing to give some extra money for these fetaures!

349623,1001,"Nothing but wind or rain lately but I finally got a chance to get a couple of flights in this morning. Ive been pleasantly surprised by the robustness of this unit. Ive flow it into obstacles numerous times, lots of crashes including a few hard ones onto pavement and its always bounced right back. I found that I havent been putting enough dihedral in the wing of the Intruder. With my modifications described below, after installing the PowerUp, I now bend the wings up slightly around the power unit. This significantly increases the flight stability in turns. I had been trying to use as little dihedral as possible and still get flyability. They would fly but it could fall off in a turn and go into a death spiral. The dihedral really helps. Todd, Im glad to hear that my post helped get you flying. But goodness, Im sorry that it worked a little too well! Ive scared myself with possible loss as well. Our field has deep grass and a couple of times it was difficult to find. I wish I had ordered a spare. Today I had mine very high several times. Id cut back and let it cruise down to a more comfortable height. I finally found a really nice throttle setting and just cruised around and around. One additional note, not all paper planes are created equal. Ill fold one and try over and over to fly it to no success, tweaking trim tabs and alignment as I go. Then Ill fold another and itll fly like crazy. So if at first you dont succeed, wad it up and fold another. The new joke at my flying field is that I buy my airframes by the ream! Dave",1928575021

331585,105,"Michael, from the kernel log below, something very strange seems to be going on. Teensy appears to be appearing on bus 3 and shows all the correct info. However, something very wrong is happening on bus 1. Whatever it is, its a high speed 480 Mbitsec USB thing, not a 12 Mbitbit device like Teensy. Is it possible this machine has a faulty hub or some other malfunctioning device Those older versions of the Gnome Modem Manger are a terrible nuisance. Years ago I exchanged emails with the developer at Red Hat who wrote it. He repeatedly promised to include a udev rule so it wont interfere with Teensy, but always lost it by the time he published a new version usually every 6 months. Multiple times, he redesigned the way the Modem Manager worked, but always forgot to include a way for known nonmodem devices to avoid getting bogged down by its probing. Eventually, dozens, maybe hundreds of bug reports piled up on Red Hats site his Modem Manager code caused lots of other products to not work and he finally improved the design to minimize interference with nonmodem devices, and put in the IDMMDEVICEIGNORE environment variable check. Sadly, some of those earlier Modem Manager versions are so bad the only solution is to delete them. I was able to reproduce the stalled Serial.printfloat bug. It appears to be something wrong with the 64 bit Linux arm gcc toolchain. The 32 bit version compiles correct code. As a quick fix, you could delete the hardwaretoolsarmnoneeabi directory, and replace it with the one from the 32 bit Linux version. Im still working on this, and I hope to have a fixed 64 bit linux toolchain by tomorrows software update. Yes, I know the search box on the PJRC site is broken. It didnt survive a server move some time ago. I really need to just remove it. I have about 6 critical features to release on this software 2 are ready for tomorrows update and half a dozen bugs to investigate Serial.printfloat being one of them.... then Im hoping to focus some time on the website, documentation, and setting up a forum.

With the firmware on The Palette today, the maximum output speed is well over 100mmmin. This is considering the worst case scenario where The Palette is making short pieces of filament over and over again. The Palette can output filament at over 600mmmin when filament is simply passing through it but it is the process of cutting, aligning, and splicing the filaments together that is the rate limiting step. The Palette is almost always waiting for the printer to consume filament so that it can make more, not the other way around.

If you dont have a fire or your drivers are moving even a little bit it must be somthing else. In pronterface has the feedrate been changed to a slower speed Not sure where to check this. Since you swapped the driver onto the X and it acted the same this probably isnt the problem, but as a side note when you say trimmed the pots how are you trimmimng your pots If you arent reading the Vref voltage when you turn the pots its very hard to get it right. You can go from a good Vref voltage to bad by turning the pot so little that the rotation is barely visible. Do you get a hammering, thump, thump sound when running the steppers Do you get a high pitched schrill sound When you touch the drivers heat sinks with your finger are they hot Try and typing in a command in Pronterface to run the extruder if you dont have any filament engaged with your hobbed bolt you can entering M302 to allow whats called cold extrusion for tseiting purposes. Use this with caution, can someone else verify that this is correct, but I think its correct to enter G1 E5 F1000. enter this only if you dont have any filament engaged or you are up to temperature.

206324,1037,"I backed this project for two reasons expandable memory and extended battery  any other features are a bonus. As far as I am aware the extended battery will act as advertised and I am fine with that. My concern is with the memory aspect and if I am misunderstanding things please let me know. I inferred from the initial video and notes that I could buy a 64GB SD card, pop it in and in effect double the capacity of a 64GB iPhone to 128GB. When I read more I realised it wouldnt be amalgamated into one 128GB memory but two 64GBs, which isnt perfect but understandable and more than good enough. Then I learned I couldnt just play music, podcasts, videos etc directly from the card memory but would need to move stuff to the iPhone memory to access it. Now I read that communication between the SD memory and the iPhone will need to be done through wifi only, which I assume means being within range of a wifi network and cant be done on the fly  moving films etc will take far longer than it should. Last of all, there is a very good chance that Apple will soon say no to any extended memory at all due to revenue they will lose by people buying this case and not a larger capacity iPhone. My point is I backed this project for an extended battery and memory that worked symbiotically and whilst I appreciate it cannot work as I first envisioned, I am disappointed with the compromises. The delays dont bother me at all by the way.",1276406064
380133,262,"Driving a DRSSTC from an analog audio input is not a trivial task. And no Mark, it cannot be achieved by simply driving an optoisolator with an audio channel. That would in fact burn out your fuse or coil all together. Sound is a sinusoidal wave for lack of a better description lets also say its 100 duty cycle where amplitude equates to volume and frequency to pitch. A DRSSTCs control signal is a digital pule train with extremely low duty cycle less than 12. Frequency of the pulse equates to pitch but pulsewidth determines the amplitude of noise coming from the coil. So some signal processing has to be done in order to drive the coil from an audio source. However the designs for DRSS Tesla coil audio modulators Ive seen require that the analog sound be monophonic in nature. So you cant play anything more detailed then late 90s ring tones through the tesla coil.",1434274012

286067,417,"Justin, you have two things wrong. While it is fine that you are a fanboy, being a rabid fanboy leads you to begin making things up entirely. One You do not need to Root Gamestick to sideload games, as it already has full root privileges. You simply need to load an APK of an Android luncher such as Apex. Then you can enjoy access to better games at better prices. Two You are wrong when you incorrectly claim that Developers set the price. Let me explain it so you can understand. PlayJam had decided on their Tiered pricing system long before GameStick had even left the factory. It is in fact what they have been doing with their Interactive TV Service for many many years. Developers simply negotiate what percentage of the revenue they will get, but the final price point is decided by Playjam. One glaring example of the Tiered Pricing system is the number of games that are entirely Free on Google play, that you have to pay for on Gamestick. The Developer is giving the game away, and Playjam is setting a price for it, as that is how Playjam makes their profit. With Prince of Persia for example, PlayJam approached Ubisoft, the developers, about getting the game as it would be a much needed addition to their game library. A pricing tier was decided upon and then negotiations took place to decide what the breakdown in profit sharing would be between PlayJam and Ubisoft. The price point was set low enough in hopes of enticing more sales, and I imagine Ubisoft demanded a bigger percentage of the profits than most indie developers might get. I began this discussion chuckling about how GameStick was still trying to stay relevant in the Android Micro Console Market. Other Micro Consoles have clearly outpaced it, while newer and more advanced systems continue to appear. Gamestick has the worst game library of them all and it is growing at the slowest pace. Their biggest investor and largest retail partner has entirely abandoned the platform, and the gaming media is labeling it a product not worth buying  if you can even find one for sale these days While Gamestop was trying to get rid of the few units on their shelves, the price plummeted rapidly and it was being referred to as a 50 piece of abandonware Die hard rabid fans like Justin will defend how amazing it is even if they have to make things up to continue the fantasy.",918228637

It is also then unclear how does the controller behave when rocking from a single button to a diagonal back to a single button A to AX back to A, whether A is registered as released between each step or the stick captures the rocking or the Xpadder software.

By the way, if someone dont know this project  You can preorder the Totem which will support HDMI connectivity, have onboard HW Acceleration, binaural sound, stereo hd cameras, individual focus per eye, and so on  in my opinion the better device than oculus here and support this small canadian company www.vrvana.com. 50 bucks preorder for final price of 450 bucks. The idea with the motion sensor sounds very cool  I cant wait to see the Seer coming real and I can have it in my hands. Thumbs up, guys, FINAL WEEK  Screen update anyone D",296001801

As I see it, the creator made a promise to ship the printer in May. If they are not able to meet that promise to a close degree, I will ask for a refund. If I dont get a refund I have 3 months from charge to get a refund directly from my credit card company. That is quickly approaching. I get that sometimes manufacturing takes time, however my assumption was that they had their ducks in a row to make it all happen in the timeframe they provided. That is why I was good with backing this product. It looks like a solid machine with a lot of the things I was looking for, so I hope it comes through, but I will also not needlessly risk a notinsignificant amount of money, ESPECIALLY if the creator does not post regular updates.

I fully agree that the campaign was handled appallingly, that the IP excuse for not releasing the video was a smoke screen and still think a video should be released. And I agree that update promises have been broken. But what had changed Other than the increasing unrest. The evidence does not point to a deliberate scam. Benson has raised his profile after the campaign, promoting the process. This is not the behaviour of a scammer. I reduced my backing because it was clear enough to me that the product was not what was being advertised, and I had doubts about the teams ability to deliver it, and I was angry about the IP excuses as I saw them. That Benson continues to be less that frank and completely open with his backers is not new. I believe they were less than honest about the fully functioning prototype, there is circumstantial evidence to that effect. If there is a deadline for a possible Amazon refund, people may want to pursue that route. I would be quite surprised if that door was open. Complaints to KS may be valid, questions at least, about the prototype. Perhaps a route would be for KS to see the unreleased video in all it fully working glory and confirm its existence... I ramble...my basic point is the evidence was there during the campaign, promises were broken immediately after the campaign, the PR remains awful...none of which is good, but nothing has changed recently to prompt the elevated level of ire. It would be slightly interesting to know if KS still have any clout over a funded project. Do Arist still need KS To me the link between Bensons post and complaints to KS is circumstantial, easy to link after the event. Keep the comments going, but anger is a wasted emotion in the circumstances...if you had faith at campaign end, then hope, prayer, crossed fingers and tranquility are your best options now Come on Benson...sort the PR out. If you can deliver on time, no one else has the time to steal the concept. Great PR and a great product means success, bad PR can sink a great product...its your call",650012718

That plus is it almost impossible to determine 1.0 from 2.0 without a deep dive into the specs of a TV and the fact that normal HDMI cables did not play nicely with MHL enabled sticks meant that even though we had produced 150 in the initial run, we decided to ditch it at the last minute after testing given we were ion borrowed time anyway. Frustrating I know. The Case  believe it or not, we know some will not, just came down to an, expensive, error at the factory. We faced the decision of delaying further and incurring even more cost by breaking down the pallets removing the cases and changing the inners or just writing it off. Given the pressure on timings and the cost of doing this we just waived it through. Packaging  we just wanted to do something specific for Kickstarter. It looks like we will be using the Kickstarter form factor over the magnetic boxes after the first batch has gone out to retail anyway. We prefer it and it is less prone to scuffing. Thanks, GameStick",918228637

Yes you have the military version of it advertised everywhere and it is a good starting point to show what you already have on hand.

288233,2583,"Regarding Games, or rather the lack of games. What people need to realize is that GameStick is a project of PlayJam, whos main goal is to be a content provider for android games on your home television. They are currently working on being the content provider for two other systems besides GameStick, and hope to get more on board. That being said, it is clear that they intend to compete agains Google Play, and thus they will do everything they can to prevent people from sideloading games from Google Play. GameSticks talk about being able to play your favorite games is marketing BS, as is their claims of being an Open system. If you have been keeping watch on the game list you will have seen that it is both severely anemic, as well as glacially slow in adding content. Major Game Developers already have outlets and would only be interested in GameStick if the revenue sharing was right. Notice how with this six months delay, they still have not been able to add one single game from a major developer. There has to be a reason why the big developers are not signing up with GameStick. Take Grand Theft Auto for example. A very successful game on Google Play with two versions available and Both are Android best sellers. They are already optimized for use with a controller, and GameStick has admitted that in tests they play well on GameStick, yet we still do not see it as available. Ask yourself why Rockstar, the developer of GTA, would choose to keep their games off of GameStick when it would take no programming effort on their part to offer them. Also keep in mind that Google offers content for your TV and is working towards getting more Google Play content to your set. As for PlayJam attempting to compete with Google Play as a content provider . . . Does anyone think this will work",918228637
292735,202,With the links posted below Im not convinced this isnt another project which just resells cheap perhaps slightly updated Chinese products... I will follow the comments and updates to see if I can be convinced but I might cancel altogether. Any experts in flashlights among the backers,1562480378
366564,988," skeezix I totally agree  Im not suggesting every decision should be run by committee  for the majority I am sure the Pimoroni guys will come good and Ill be happy with what they decided. That said, it wouldnt hurt to talk to your backers a bit more to see if your decisions are aligning with their expectations ahead of time, especially when they are crucial ones such as only supporting certain motherboards or how hackable the control interface is. The previous update was the kind of meat Im sure were all interested in, yet when I attempted to ask pertinent questions at the time about the singledual player issue there was no reply. The decisions are already made when the update comes out and then thats it. It doesnt actually matter what Im expecting for 1 vs 2 player  we all signed up for 1 player  its the lack of interactivity and updates that I take issue with. For the record the original description talked about hacking on a second player so I was assuming wed be left some free inputs to connect however we want, but thats not really the point. As regards Ultimarc  those interfaces are pretty ubiquitous in the world of homemade arcade machines so I would hope that using these e.g. by licensing the firmware to put into the picade board rather than buying an expensive lot of boards was at least considered without anyone having to preempt it. Again though  a bit more transparency and this would all have come out during the design process. As you may have guessed by now, what I am really objecting to is the radio silence in between updates. It was 3 weeks in between updates last time and the only comment from Pimoroni was about Outrun! People want to know how its going. E.g. Paradiso asked a few basic questions. That was 3 days ago  why not just write a few sentences At the end of the day we all want the team working on the Picade, but come on, theres only 3 or 4 people even asking questions  it shouldnt impact progress to come on here and talk to us a bit more. Maybe we have some input that might be useful These arent difficult questions either  does the lack of response mean we are behind schedule Maybe Im just having a bad week already.

355564,1478,"A few thoughts First This is by far not the worst KickStarter ever. Yeah, they are late... VERY late. But there are others that have been later or never delivered. Second How do we know that BestBuy didnt give Lifx money My guess is they did and probably had a much more iron clad legal agreement in place with Lifx meaning they faced serious consequences if they didnt deliver. I also suspect that they intended to have the backers bulbs to them before their deadline to supply BestBuy came into place, but they slipped and missed... badly. So now what They can do the right thing and supply all the backers first even though supposedly the BestBuy deal came before the backer campaign. This means not meeting contractual obligations and potentially facing monetary penalties from Best Buy. Or they can fulfill BestBuy and be even more late with deliveries to backers... who dont have much of any legal standing to demand anything or sue for being late. It SUCKS... big time. But from a purely business perspective its the right move to fill BestBuy assuming a contact and if the BestBuy deal really was before the Kickstarter campaign, then its in fact the right thing to do to fill them first too. Third, Other Retailers... How do we know that A. These other retailers arent backers as well or B. These other retailers didnt get a bulk shipment from BestBuy or C. These other retailers arent just partners of BestBuy online and are really selling BestBuys stock Dont get me wrong here... Im not trying to excuse Lifx. Im very disappointed in their terrible lateness of delivery, and they should have been talking about BestBuy, or at the very least about a retail partner if they couldnt name BestBuy so it doesnt look like it was sprung on us last minute. Furthermore, it is possible that this is all a lie and there wasnt any early deal with BestBuy. I guess Im just not in the Im so excited, I just cant wait! camp that Im going to be horribly upset if I dont get my bulbs in the next week. I can fully understand if you are... thats fine, but make sure you know all the facts before throwing out too many accusations.",1234309959
194259,840,"For those that believe Dans assessments, there is a lot he does not realize. When a product comes to market, there is a lot of research that goes into it. Most of it is looking into what is available on the market, what parts are available, and are there any patents for the end product. You could see 20 videos of a coffee maker using an RF reader, but until a patent or a commercial product is produced, it is out there for anyone to use. Parts  for certain items like coffee makers, there are only a small handful of manufactures for heating elements, grinders, etc. I would put my bets on more than half the single serve coffee makers use several parts from the same manufactures. No single company will build an item from the ground up using all their own components in todays market. Cost would be too high. Now in my opinion, if this was a scam, why continue to redesign, offer refunds, talk about delays... If they could have just kept silent and ran with the money Until they ask for more funding or crowd source at another site, this is not grounds for a scam.

132297,528,"Hi German Palomino, We take the security of your personal information very seriously. We are a Level One PCI Certified Provider and follow PCI rules. We do not store mag stripe track data on the phones application memory, nor do we store them in the cloud. We enable the consumer to store their own track data in an encrypted format, onto a secure chip inside the Loop Fob or Loop ChargeCase, very similar to NFC storing the card data on a secure chip. There are no rules against a consumer securely storing and controlling their own track data in their own protective environment. Consumers store our own plastic cards in a leather wallet, or keep them in a drawer when they dont want to carry too many pieces of plastic. Loop enables a consumer to store the same cards, any type of mag stripe card  credit, debit, loyalty, gift, proprietary cards, in their own secure chip which they control, and it is locked with their PIN so it is more secure than their leather wallet if it is lost or stolen. Loop is providing consumers the ability and the choice to securely store, organize and use the cards in their own wallet. Note that there is a difference between the mag stripe track data on the card and the card numbers that merchants often keep on file on their servers. The track data contains additional information that your card issuer provide which authenticates that the data came from the magnetic stripe and not by keying in a number read from the card. PCI does not allow the storage of track data by a third parties, we do not store track data. We do store a copy of the card number in an encrypted format to our PCI Level 1 data center, per PCI requirements, much like many big merchants who store your card number on file for faster checkout. When you want to view the card number on the LoopWallet app, the app contacts our backend system, after you validate with your PIN and have logged in with your password, we decrypt and display the data for you for up to 60 secs. You can also optionally store the CVV2CID data from the card on your phone separately from the cloud. Since you are storing the CVV2CID yourself, as the card holder, you are not breaking the PCI requirements, note that no card data is stored on your phone, it is just a 3 or 4 digit number in your phone. A pin password gives you a lot more time to cancel your credit cards than your wallet can offer. Thank you for your support! We cant do this without your help! Take care, The Loop Team",53970379

246345,697,"Second Guess 1. What we do is. We measure how the headphones driver produces the sound and based on the result, we set one ideal frequency response target and then let the Dirac algorithm process the sound to improve both frequency response and impulse response. A headphone driver at any price or even with an unlimited budget  can not produce a perfect sound from all aspects, this is why the DSP correction makes sense, it improves on the mechanical limitations that the headphone have. 2. Many brands spend huge amounts of money on packing and marketing. Investing in that add cost and in turn a higher price. Secondly, being a large big brand is no guarantee that the sound is the sound that YOU like. Sound is often a matter of TASTE so we try to overcome this with DSP by not only improving the sound to one ideal sound, but we provide choices of character as well, so it matched your own taste of sound with a sustained quality! The strategy to spend much money on the products, instead of the marketing  have been our strategy for 10 year  this makes Kickstarter perfect for us and you. We have been used to be being run over by the big brands powerful marketing, so its nice to see the wind turning! 3. Since we have created Earphone 12 and Earphone Sports at this manufacturing plant, we have a credit deal with them that guarantee a spot in the production line if the Kickstarter is successful  the design is being finalized and worked on during the Kickstarter  this leaves us with about two months where we can produce the headphone and deliver it to backers and because of our previous experience, we see no reason for delays, not even this late in the current product stages. So we have a good relationship with the factory and they will support us with quick production time. 4. Please see our previous answer. 5. I really understand why you ask and to be skeptical is a good approach. Since we have already produced Headphones with this manufacturer, we know how to work together and be cost effective though all stages of the product creation  from design, testing, tooling and final production.We also produced other products for years. By using Kickstarter we remove the marketing investments and can then lower the price of Headphone Divine temporary. This means that we can give backers a very low price, but it also means that this is limited and that we have to go back to a higher price once the Kickstarter is finished so that we can continue to provide a quality service and continue development of the product. We also have staff in Sweden, China and USA ready to support current and future products. Syrius de Goratrix We will have a look at what is possible.

199473,156,"Thanks. Does this mean that the existing software does not already have a test for signal strengthquality, and is the software not already able to behave gracefullyrobustly such as by displaying a warning instead of displaying wrong or misleading readings when the signal is insufficient If the existing software is already able to detect and gracefully handle poor signals, then it seems to me that there is nothing more you have to do, or try to be responsible for. If we use bad extension cables or too long extension cables, that is our problem, not yours. All the software has to do is say poor or no signal or something like that, and we will just shorten our cables or use better cables until the software is happy. Does the software not already behave this way So it is not clear to me, at least for an initialexperimental implementation, why you would have to be in the business of testing cable lengths and types, since you would not or should not be supplying extension cables, or be the sole supplier of cables. I do recognize that it is appropriate for Vaavud to be investigating cables in order to make recommendations on cable length or type. But initially, you can just let the user be the one to worry this and let the user be responsible for adjusting cable length and type to satisfy the software. Correct me if wrong, in the current state of the device and software, but there is nothing to prevent us from mounting the sensor outdoors pointing north, using an extension cable, and orienting the smartphone indoors to point north so as to get a correct absolute reading on direction, right If so, then implementing the fixed orientation mode would save us the trouble and restriction of having to point the indoors smartphone north. We would be able to get a correct reading regardless of the orientation of the indoor smartphone.",767076429

A lady up ahead waved to flag me down, She got in at the light. Oh, where you going to, my lady blue, Its a shame you ruined your gown in the rain. She just looked out the window, and said Sixteen Parkside Lane. Something about her was familiar I could swear Id seen her face before, But she said, Im sure youre mistaken And she didnt say anything more. It took a while, but she looked in the mirror, And she glanced at the license for my name. A smile seemed to come to her slowly, It was a sad smile, just the same. And she said, How are you Harry I said, How are you Sue Through the too many miles And the too little smiles I still remember you.  It was somewhere in a fairy tale, I used to take her home in my car. We learned about love in the back of the Dodge, The lesson hadnt gone too far. You see, she was gonna be an actress, And I was gonna learn to fly. She took off to find the footlights, And I took off to find the sky. Oh, Ive got something inside me, To drive a princess blind. Theres a wild man, wizard, Hes hiding in me, illuminating my mind. Oh, Ive got something inside me, Not what my lifes about, Cause Ive been letting my outside tide me, Over till my time, runs out. Babys so high that shes skying, Yes shes flying, afraid to fall. Ill tell you why babys crying, Cause shes dying, arent we all. There was not much more for us to talk about, Whatever we had once was gone. So I turned my cab into the driveway, Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns. And she said we must get together, But I knew itd never be arranged. And she handed me twenty dollars, For a two fifty fare, she said Harry, keep the change. Well another man might have been angry, And another man might have been hurt, But another man never would have let her go... I stashed the bill in my shirt. And she walked away in silence, Its strange, how you never know, But wed both gotten what wed asked for, Such a long, long time ago. You see, she was gonna be an actress And I was gonna learn to fly. She took off to find the footlights, And I took off for the sky. And here, shes acting happy, Inside her handsome home.

173073,8591,"Some of my thoughts on some recent comments 1. Neptune is a relatively new and a small company at that. For them to create such a device with this functionality is speaking magnitudes already. So far they have been transparent with us on what they can or cannot create. They are even making the effort to reach out to us by updates and polls Kickstarter should create their polling system now I guess. If those efforts arent enough, try and think about what Apple, Samsung, etc. Do you think they directly communicate with their customers on what features should go into their products I dont think so. Not on this level I suppose. 2. We have a lot of expectations on what this device can be and mostly its because of Pines slogan aggressive marketing of being a standalone device. Having said that, we still dont have an idea on how it will revolutionize the whole mobile market. Wearables are still a niche market and we are expecting a lot of features that while it is technologically possible, may not even make sense right now. Cmon people, even Google glass doesnt even know what it is for!!! 3. Stretch goals sweeten the deal, but remember, we already backed it. So why are we still even complaining about the stretch goals Isnt the base functionality enough If it isnt, then a backer should think hard if this device is what they really want. Yes, I understand that we want more for our money, but we are getting a pretty sweet deal here already. We are already early adopters, and we are getting an early adopter price. What else will you compare it to The smaller memory Omate The highly negative publicized Rock The high priced Galaxy Gear 4. Remember, Kickstarter is not a store, its a place where we want to support a companyindividuals to achieve their project goals so that eventually they can sell it to us. It just so happens that they are making the actual watch as the reward. Look at Occulus Rift, while they are rewarding their backers with the device itself, its still a development kit, or a beta product. Meaning the backers completely know that they are getting prototype devices, and not yet the real and final thing. Why cant we apply it here then Neptune is benefiting from us and we should understand that we are also benefiting with them. They couldve gone the other way and made this private and just sell them completely without community feedback. 5. Obviously everyone of us here believe in this product so thats why we are here, but this incessant need for making Neptune look like the bad guys here wont help anyone. If you dont believe it anymore, then you can support the other smartwatches out there. No one is forcing us to stay here. I believe I read a user, ThaWulf who backed this again because he thinks the Rock is a scam. Thats what you call faith!!! So people, lets support Neptune, now more than ever, its almost January 2014. Once they pull it off, we guys have the most awesome device of the smartwatch revolution!!!",550709039

387342,200,"Okay  Comment 42 is the one the broke the camels back. To repost Will Solomon comment on the update So were about four times the original time to market and your update is focussing on the texture differences between the blue and the white plastics and the slipperyness of the base Really I have backed 68 projects, most of them hardware, so I get that Kickstarter is not a store  its a promise to try. You get the money, you try to make it happen and you tell us what is going on. Maybe it just doesnt work and we get nothing. I am okay with that if it was an honest attempt. I am still optimistic about a different project that is 3 years late. But here is why I am so irritated with this project. It is that you are optimizing for your future business needs over the needs of your backers and you did NOT make that clear in your video. The main reason I back projects on Kickstarter is to get early access to emerging technologies. I expect them to be rough literally, to have beta software, to have flaws. But the one advantage is that we get to try them sooner than waiting for the nice box at Home Depot. If your video had said we will delay it as long as it takes to make it Staples ready then I wouldnt have funded it. It is a legitimate business decision but I feel it is not in the spirit of kickstarter. Other projects get the rough 1.0 version to backers, learn from the feedback and then take what they have learned to other funding sources for a traditional company launch. So  Can I get a refund Because it seems you are weeks or months away from shipping anything because you keep optimizing for the future business. But even if it was overnighted to me tomorrow, I worry it wouldnt be worth learning your proprietary system because, to quote another backer, you have already been lapped by the competition and your havent even shipped yet. So  once again  is a refund possible Could you answer that question with a yes or no With 1694 backers, I am sure some people would prefer to wait until the nearly invisible mark above the hole for the lightpipe is fixed. But if any of the 454,976 is left, perhaps you could refund the people that had hoped for an experimental platform. How about it",941348329
467780,23,"I can confirm all the things which are posted by other supporters. Before I have had made a pledge I asked Dillenger following questtion  Is this bike a pedelec or an ebike. In Germany the meaning of Pedelec is, that you have to use the pedals to drive and the emotor just give you an support. It helps you as lon you are stepping on the pedals. If you stop to use the pedals, the emotor support also stops. An ebike is a bicycle which drives also without using the pedals. What kind of bike is the Dilenger Cheetah I got these answer from Sam  Hi Detlef, the Cheetah is a pedelec. The Cheetahs sent to USA have a throttle but the Cheetahs sent to UK and EU countries arrive in the EN15195 format to be legal. Sam This is not the fact. My bike has a throttle and it will drive without using the pedals. In Germany, and I think also in many other european countries you need an insurance for this kind of ebike its NOT a pedelec and also a driver license. I think this piece a chinese junk ist not a development of Dillenger. In my opinion they have bought this bike from any chinese manfacturer. Ok, for this low price you cannot expect a topquality bike, but this bike is only cheap  in every detail.

In such an invronment the software design for a TIKOstyle printer would have one uitrhread, one slicer thread and one firmware thread. Each of them running at the same time, processing things. So I would assume, that the firmware thread already starts printing as soon as the slicer thread allready has the very first gcode instruction available and that should be almost immediatly. From that point on, the slicer finishes definitly much faster just software than firmware and hardware mechanics ivolved are able to. So there would never be a noticable delay due to the on board slicing. And of course the TIKO can perform gcode. The concept of TIKO just wants get the process chain between gcode generation slicer and gcode processing firmware closed by processing it all within the same processing environment. And I can not say enough how I prever that no need to handle three different types of software, getting them installed and alligned to each other.

If you let the charge run down to far, youll permanently damage your batteryit probably wont explode in the light, but it probably will when you charge it next. Usually a protection circuit shuts the battery down when it gets to about 2.52.7 volts, but its best to recharge it when it gets down to about 3.4 volts. If youre not confident about monitoring the state of charge yourself, stick to protected cells. I recommend not trying to move the protection circuit from one cell to another.

Looked at power supply LED and it is blinking. Plugged in and out several times. Still blinking. Closed lid and plugged in again and it came to life. Okay weird. Initialized and stated LID OPEN. No. the LID was closed. LID has play so it moves sideways too much. Magnet switch in unit is positioned center with round magnet in lid. Magnetic field gets canceled out. Tried rotating round magnet to get LID to state closed when it is really closed. Determined round magnet in LID needs offset in LID 12 inch to one side to activate magnetic switch properly then lid will be happy with the amount of side to side play in LID.

63850,70,"I agree 100 with you Dylan. This is my first kickstarter involvement and represents a lot of money on my behalf and there has been a lot in the news of high profile failures lately, and I just think they are unnecessarily causing concern for no good reason whatsoever. What would it take  2 minutes of time to do a couple of sentence update The reward for that tiny investment is keeping everyone onside and patient and allowing us to update our expectations according to any variations in the plans. They are opening themselves up for a whole bunch of negativity  completely unnecessarily. Its not that I have changed my mind and think they wont deliver a good product, but it certainly starts putting doubt. Sure they are busy, but communicating with customers has to be somewhere near the top of the priority list. The reality probably will end up being the timeframes taking longer than they originally advertised  so why not have them take another 2 minutes longer and actually communicate with us so we at least know where we stand. If I get mine 7 days late and there has been little communication then I will be angry at it being a week late. If I get it 10 days late but have been updated along the way I will probably have nonelittle of the negative feelings and just be happy to get it.

What about sniffing the communication between the phone and the lock Could the signal be duplicated If you use the lock in the same place every day it would be simple to put something near by to catch signals. On the bottom of the heel of the shackle long end what you call the shank there is a button to activate the lock. What if somebody were to come along and give the bottom of the lock or the top of the shackle a good smack with the hammer Would this break that switch and render the lock inoperable How thick is the shackle How thick are the sides of the lock and the face plates Are they strong enough to prevent somebody from smashing the face of the lock and destroying any boards What material is the body and parts going to be made of A cheaper zamac alloy for parts and similar can simply be melted inside the lock with a torch. You showed the lock on the back of a trailer. What kind of testing havewill you do to determine if it can handle the roughness, shaking, bouncing, vibrating, etc that being on the road can present Will all the electronics be secure When taking the back off to replace the battery, it appears to screw off. How is it held in place What if somebody took a pair of slip jaw pliers or a moneypipe wrench to the back and tried turning it off You also said that you can use a pin to replace the battery when it is dead and you cant open the lock.

I am unable to use the full PLA stick because issues start to arise when the stick gets to the end. So I have to open the hatch and take out the remainder of the stick. Its pretty wasteful of you dont have a version one pen, I do so I snip the ends and use them in my version one pens. I have no issues whatsoever with the ABS setting.

There are a few that the quality was disappointing but at least I got the product. Unfortunately, Chelseas lack of responsibility or outright FRAUD which IS prosecutable is going to make it harder for other newbies to get backing on their projects. Since she received almost half a million dollars, that could become a Prosecutable Fraud Offense. Anyone interested in pursuing it It might help clean up kickstarter, if people were held legally responsibly if they commit Deliberate FRAUD.

The crowd funding business model allows for people like Chelsea to take or for better words. Steal our hard earned moneydollars. They all hide behind a thin veil of an agreement. Both Crowd Funding and the alleged companies. Consumer theft and consumer abuse needs to stop. We work hard while they take and leave us with an excuse. There is and will be solutions. We will no longer be abused. Shown unethical behavior and treatment. This is a new business model with no regulations. This is why we the consumers have been constantly ripped off. A play of words will have its holes. This is not the first company. There will soon be advocates that will stand up for this behavoir and challenge and make change so that we the consumer or the VCs never ever get ripped off again. Too many horrific stories of so, so many people being ripped off and then told by both of the Crowd Funding platforms that they cannot or will not do anything to help us. This is wrong. Morally wrong. Fiscally wrong. ConsumerHumanity wrong. Really. Plain and simple. Wrong. This is my opionion and is not a direct assault or slander against anyone. It is my opinion that state and federal governments need to hear the voices of the people. This is a Democracy. Not another Wall Street HedgeBanker Toxic money scam.

10598,1239,"Received mine yesterday feb backer and I am disappointed. First, the product is flimsy. I expected some level of flimsiness since this is a 200 product but I was pretty shocked. Ive already shaped one of the parts part O because it was just too thin  bad design. Second, there are a lot of parts missing and some parts that clearly do not belong to this product. They have been reports of missing parts though out this campaign so its amazing to me that they still havent figured out how fix these problems. Third, the instructions are terrible. I still do not know how to attach the print head assembly to the drive belt. There doesnt seem to be any indication on how to do it. A zip tie perhaps They also designed some of the parts so that they can be easily flipped and installed the wrong way around. These parts could have been easily keyed to prevent this. I had do disassemble some of the assemblies a few times before I got things flipped around to the right configuration  bad engineering in my option. There should be only one way the parts fit together. Fourth, there are no limits switches. To me, that means the product is incomplete since the machine can probably damage itself if it exceeds its limits. Fifth, I still do not know how to attach the heated bed to the drive mechanism. There instructions show a screw part HW11 that goes through the bed support and the undercarriage. There is a spring between them however, the inner diameter of the spring is smaller than the outer diameter of the screw so its impossible to get the screw through the spring exceptionally difficult anyway. Is this bad design or wrong parts or both All in all, it wasnt worth the wait or the money as it clearly wont last long.

3732,2227,"Dungeonstone  if you were in the Beta batch and you didnt receive the Beta printer than you should be trying to contact P3D through the forums or through something other means. If you have with no response, then I dont know. On that note if you backed the BETA but decided you didnt want to not have all the features and told them you were going to OPT into the April batch then you kind of agreed to waiting. If you were following along with what was going on they stated when they saw the issue that people didnt want a Beta Printer they said let them know and theyd send you the Beta, all others were going to be considered part of the April batch. Yes April is long gone but things changed. The Beta backers found issue with the design and the hardware. On top f that the heated bed became a item that they had to figure out since they needed something that would look and work with what they want. Hints to why its taking so long. On top of that Im sure with the conference they went to they probably talked with other companies while there and found that not having something like the certification of the hardware behind the machine was a dangerous legal issue waiting to happen. Was this communicated properly, probably not but lets face it, if I had a product I know will sell I would want to protect my assets from potential lawsuits. That and there are states in the US and countries all around the world that state if its not a Kit printer User assembled then Certification is required or you arent bringing it in. As per the financial note, they are a business. the funds they earned from use were put into salaries and Testing but were also most likely used to get a business loan. These loans can be 20 million USD depending on how they present themselves to the bank. As for your comment on why the production batch was able to be sent without the certification is because of the labeling on the box. Prototype. This tells the countrycustoms the printer is being tested and is in all sense not a finished product, which most companies throw them into the Kit version as tinkering will be done on the machine in field. Our units are Production Batch which means they wont have the Prototype label. They will not Require tinkering even though Im sure some of us will tinker anyway. Y should have expect these delays on a Product Kickstarter of this magnitude. Im sorry for being blunt on that one but looking at what youve backed previsouly, this is your first Technology driven project and technology rarely place nice during conceptions. Everyone  Basic Project Management has 5 phases. Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closure. Initiation Phase RD before Kickstarter, designs, plans and initial testing and funding given by investors. Then the Kickstarter began and ended. The Planning phase hasnt technically began yet. Planning phase hits full swing anywhere from immediately to weeks after kickstarter funding ends. this is where scheduling normally begins as well as budgeting and a lot of other aspects. note scheduling is set here. That means alot can change in the next phase. Execution phase our current phase This phase is where the product is developed in full. Dont get this phase name as its building the final product. In the case of this kickstarter and the essence of this project it is tying up the design, testing, Improvements, Testing, redesign for use, testing, prototyping, testing, Beta machines 80 complete sent out to Beta Testers, Testing, Prerelease, Certifications and testing, Then comes the actual production. Note how much testing is in their. also note, this isnt even the most complicated project Ive seen. The testing does happen all the time in this phase for this kind of product. Monitoring and Controlling the next phase This is where quality control while the printers are being manufactured Final production. this Phase happens after the Execution phase. It runs all the way through product delivery in a retail sense and sometimes even after product delivery begins. This is to ensure what goes out matches the approved Version 1.0 printer which we still havent seen yet Version 1.0 will be after certification. Closure All printers are completed for kickstarter and the printers hit the open market. This phase ends the project. This doesnt mean the printers are no longer sold, just the project of starting up the printing process. This is the basic setup for a project. Be aware this is mild compared to other projects of a similar nature. Ive been involved with these kinds of projects. and Ill state again, for the majority who are not waiting on a BETA printer, we backed the Full production model which means fully working as would be sold in stores. The descrition of the project when we backed says this. The certification is necesary to acheive what weve backed. Again if you were in the BETA batch and didnt get the BETA printer then take that up with P3D. If you decided to wait from the BETA batch of printers, then you agreed to what we are waiting those of us who didnt want a BETA to begin with. You cant want everything and expect no delay or friction. Reality bites, but it is reality.",653475927

On the other hand I dont know of a single other company offering everything that Arist has promised, let alone in the tiny form factor promised or within an order of magnitude of the price promised. So in the future, please be more careful when you make these outrageous comparisons! And lets be more grateful to Team Arist for developing so many new technological breakthroughs so as to obsolete the entire coffee industry. Go Team Arist!",650012718

It was delayed in Beta, it was delayed in KS deliveries. Now that part is over. We were here supporting you on time and with funding.

194034,615,"From evANGEList To Team Arist Re Suggestion to Improve Communications Policy There have been repeated complaints that there has not been enough transparency to give backers confidence either in the integrity of Team Arist or its product. Many backers have become skeptical of Team Arists repeated assertion that transparency cannot be provided because of pending patents and some are concerned this is an excuse which is intended to delay and deceive. If Team Arist didnt want to be transparent they should have pursued Private Equity instead of Crowd Funding because they knew a crowd funding campaign would require open communications and transparency. The manner in which communications has been conducted to date is perceived by many not only as highly unprofessional but even amateur. Every company faces a dilemma how to balance protecting their intellectual property rights with transparency while patents are pending  this is not unique to Team Artist. There is much to be learned from how other companies handle this tradeoff in a professional manner which instills confidence rather than rebuke. The following is taken from an update from another KS project which addresses this very issue. It would behoove Team Arist to read the following and learn from it before its current communications policy risks further reputational damage names below redacted using  . Counterfeiters Trying to Copy  Design One of the companies that we are working with for a component of  told us that they were approached by another party that is working to copy the  design.

Our belief is that the benefits from  input on decisions outweigh the potential cost of someone copying the design. We anticipated that this would happen after the success of  on Kickstarter. Please know there is nothing to worry about, we have several design and utility patents pending for . As a precaution we plan to publish future updates with engineering details to backers only.

I dont appreciate being called a spokesman for their company because I am not, we invested in this to see if a mass market budget option would be usable for basic solutions, but what I do know is what patents are filed around eye tracking techniques, technology, methodology and implementation, and therefore from the little bit of footage I have seen of the NUIA as someone who does this for a living I can see similarities more than a little between their corneal reflection image and the information contained within the patents. With all the calls for fraud, I believe you havent maybe understood or considered my points  250,000 or even 500,000 is not enough to get this product to market unless there was a lot of the product already completed behind the scenes and the money for tooling and so on was already in place. I am not defending NUIA I am simply stating that maybe they underestimated the costs and  or were not as close to delivery as they thought and  or cannot make the product work and have run out of funds. The patent issue I believe is genuine but, and as I stated before, any patent challenge does not stop a company from responding to questions or messages, it simply means there is a challenge going on. If we expand on this further lets look at the previous updates  the eye camera image and footage could have been done with any solution, there hasnt been a fuller example of the work done nor anything barring some code snapshots which could be anything. To summarise my points so there is no ambiguity  1 I think the patent claim may be genuine 2 I think they underestimated the cost to get to market 3 I think that they dont have a fully working product, nor are they close to  especially with regards to head movement compensation and glasses etc 4 I think they have run out of money 5 we backed this to see if it could be done as we were sceptical from the outset but saw potential There have been numerous projects that have gone like this Zion Eyez for one and there will be more, what we as backers deserve and should look for is comment and explanation from NUIA.",1806697040

324526,362,"Wayne May While lithium batteries can explode under certain conditions, the majority of these cases are of alternate chemistry e.g. Lithium Iron, rather than Lithium Manganese known commonly as lithium polymer. These incidents are typically during discharge when the C rating is exceeded, or during charging after either an overvoltage excursion, or when the cell has inverted due to excessive discharge. The former case can be prevented by a BMS battery monitoring system which is standard on all battery modules now, coupled with the use of a charge controller. This is why it used to be bad to leave a phone on the charger constantly, and why it is now safe to do so. The second case inversion is when the battery has been discharged to the point where it appears to be a dead short to the charger. Once again proper battery management prevents overheating and a fire.This condition is most commonly associated with high density Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries, rather than the common lithium polymer batteries.

264141,301,"Backers support the project in good faith and show it with their own money, so I find it interesting and suspicious why some tools keep defending a creator of the project who choose not to be transparent right from the start I asked the creator some very legitimate questions, questions that creator of a tech project ought to have specify and have good knowledge of. I ask Tim Roxas what are the shell made of how many modes are there anyone with a light in his hand can give me a straight answer in 15sec so when the creator choose to ignore a straight forward question, it is red flag for me. Cory Magel lied that I have a habit of sabotaging a project. I have backed over 50 projects and this is about the second or third one that I have problems with the other being Mbox and GoPlug and Im not the first or only one to being unhappy or question the project so thats hardly a habit is it I call into question your integrity or interest in this. For someone whos only been to Kickstarter a month ago, youre either very ignorant, naive or just a fool. Why shouldnt I question the creator if he cant grasp the fundamentals of the project properly If you dont like me being a straight shooter, then ignore my posts than life will be easier for you. Maybe you should stop living in the dream world and get real for once. . It is a heavy responsibility to take backers money and pretend it is ok not being transparent with them. I still have not seen the project timeline or at least let us know how the project is going to be manage who we can evaluate the risk and decide. Giving some fictitious name and standing in front of a machine is supposed to answer the question...how Bottomline is a legit project need to stand up to close scrutiny this one have holes and questions all over, and now the creator Tim Roxas is logging in on multiple user account talking to himself and attempt to give him some credibility, how lame is that . Tim Roxas and his tools let me be crystal clear with you...Im not here to sabotage your project I have nothing to gain, I want clarity and honesty. I want to know why are you trying to hide specs and details from the audience and only reluctantly give half arsed answers after being questioned. There are too many projects here at KS that got called out because the project creator just being unrealistic and worst act in bad faith and backers ended up being burned for hundred of thousand dollars. I got burned more than a few time and also got saved because fellow members here ask the hard questions which the creator will try to denydivertignore at first I was 800 into Mblok project before saw the lights when fellow members with much better knowledge than me start asking the hard questions. As you might know the project got funded then dropped out in the final 2 days. The KS community here need some check and balances so we dont get creepy and dubious characters nicking hard earned money off unsuspecting backers. On the final note, many members here have known me for months and know that I have no bad intention to bad mouth a legit project. I run a much larger business and have little time looking at projects but I will always support guys with creative ideas and needing a bit of support to get their project off the ground...but on the other hand we have a LightMan project which for all the information that I gather will amount to nothing more than a toy light that will not stand any moderate amount of daily usage. Also a creator who have just registered with Kickstarter, having no track record to speak off, not to mention breaking multiple Kickstarter rules as well as impersonating various character to give himself a false impression of repute raise a red flag as far as Im concern. .

Since we are not expecting our shirts until August, RA has until July to fix all of these concerns, and I am not worried at this point. as far as the colors not being features. The fact is, its not very easy to simply make different colors work for the colorchanging technology. It actually DOES take more time and research to get a new color to work, something they probably could NOT have done without extra money. Just a thought ",432703172

Thanks for the response, at no point was I accusing the Creator of cheating or telling lies, so before you start advising on if we should stop backing on kickstarter, please also read the rights we as backers have, and one of those rights is asking questions which I did with reference to what the creator stated on their Risk  Challenge. So as a backer on KickStarter I have every right to Ask questions!! And people asking for refunds and calling the creator fraud I feel is not called for.",1636168806

122825,180,"Agustin The issue has been debated months ago. Apparently, the Apples requirements for applications that accompany a piece of hardware are different than for applications that dont read much worse. Apparently, the piece of hardware the SS in this case has to be designed by an Apple authorizedcertified designer which Labnation aint and and this is worse produced by an Apple authorizedcertified factory, which would reduce the Labnations choices and increase costs. Also and this is the worst... apparently, the device itself should be a Made for iPodiPhone device which, among other things, would make the device only compatible with said iDevices and no other platform. All three stumble blocks but especially the last one make the possibility of an Apple blessed SS app... thin.

429373,513,"greedy, rant You have become rude and personal. I have been specific, to the point and open. I am not the only one who is dissatisfied with Manukas attitude. Frankly, I am far less concerned about actually getting a mediocre from the majority of descriptions on here gyroscope, than I am about the blatant abuse of a dominant position by the creators. They did not raise a few coppers, they raised close to half a MILLION dollars, and they are treating backers with disregard. If they wanted to prove when delivery took place, for 350 guaranteed items, they could have used tracking. They didnt. So now they should suck it up and refund immediately all backers whos guarantee was not met. This delaying, demanding the backers send items back if I understand correctly, at the backers expense is an extremely poor attitude for a startup company. No rants, no greed. Just valid points",1143380572

16452,81,"Their plan is not to delay the app  the plan is to release them both when the unit ships. If there are delays, theyre not planned  they would be out of the teams control. Theyre just going to build the iOS one first, top to bottom, so that the Android build goes smoother. Theres 2 versions of iOS that covers the near whole amount of Apple users 94 as of Oct 5th. Sure, Jellybean covers half the Android users, but after that, to hit the same majority mark, you have to factor in 3 other operating systems. KitKat is the newest and it barely has 25 of the Android market share as of Sept 2014. Think of it this way  millions of mistakes and things are going to be learned in the iOS app. It could end up taking longer than expected. BUT, the end result will be that all those experiences will hopefully turn into a smoother, quicker Android app development. Disclaimer Im def not with the emberlight team I wish!, but I am quite tired of people complaining about a development choice, when end product promise is still the same. Be glad that the team is being so open about their choices and so transparent. If you got backlash like this every time you tried to share something, wouldnt you want to stop sharing",1346224271
