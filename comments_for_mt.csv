2,422207,62,"Dont worry Patrick. It is normal that slows down a bit. I have backed 19 projects now and always you see a quick start, a slow middle and a strong finish. Besides the project has 3 weeks to go, Im still confident the project will attrack around 200 backers and somewhere around 8000. I was thinking.

11,1450156,1,"Qtechknow Team, I get that the stretch goal is to get the product on the Sparkfun store, but as a backer, it would be nice to know what exactly that money is going towards to hit the goal. Are you simply signing a check to Sparkfun Is it for parts or manufacturing equipment What does Sparkfun require that the extra money will provide The question isnt what will happen when you hit that stretch goal, but why. I suppose its moot at this point, but its generally good to let people know the breakdown of what that extra money will do to make that stretch goal a reality. Otherwise it can seem like an arbitrary line in order to get more money for the fund raiser.",,,,,,,,
12,1450156,6,"Jeremy The reason that we have this stretch goal is that SparkFun plans to only manufacture the boards for this run, not more afterwards.

That pledge level seems to be available to everyone regardless of past support and is actually more than the early bird level that was also available to anyone.

In the corporate world I work in day to day the lack of communication on project status for this length of time would have resulted in at least one involuntary separation from the company by now, this behavior would not be tolerated at all. The fact that the creator of this project intentionally ignores requests for updates speaks volumes about the person and the company were dealing with here and I for one am fed up with it.

63,13577217,41,Arrived just now!,,,,,,,,
64,13577217,214,"Brenton, Thanks for working on such a neat project. Im not quite ready to spring for something like the Mindstorms set, so this is a great first introduction for my kids that is much more budget friendly. Im excited to receive our Edisons, it will be hard to wait until the end of the year! I have a few comments regarding functionality that could be added after release, and Im sure youre busy with lots of other things getting this project polished and ready for production, but I thought Id list them now. 1 Is there a chance you will release the specifications for the IR communication protocol Id love to be able to add a few additional sensors. While direct connection to Edison would be great, I know you need to stop somewhere if you want to keep it affordable and allowing electrical connections to the robot just makes it easier for someone to break it.  Using something like an Arduino to read additional sensors and provide those readings via IR through the receive and transmit functions in EdWare would make that possible, though. This would also allow communication with something like a base station, perhaps involving a PC using a webcam for image analysis or the like and issuing commands to control the robot. 2 Would it be possible to add a simple subroutine functionality to EdWare I understand that it needs to remain simple. Ive played with EdWare for just a bit, but found it a little difficult to rearrange the program flow if I need to change something. Being able to build the basic program structure out of subroutine calls wouldnt even need to pass or return parameters would allow me to more easily modify those subroutines, and would also give my kids a good way to learn how to break a task down into steps and address those one at a time. I could also be misunderstanding how EdWare works, so if functionality like this exists, please ignore my comment. 3 Any chance of adding a Read Barcode function to EdWare This would allow some functionality for more complicated software to make some settings or even run an entirely different set of routines depedning on the bar code read. Well, thats enough of my comments. Good luck with the finishing up! Scott",,,,,,,,

75,14858372,38,Jim  Thanks for your comments. The encoder wheel does have small dots but you would need to press on it for you to get a good grip . It needs some getting used to as the wheel itself is small. After a few tries I can rotate it real fast but yes those larger wheels are easier to spin.

91,16847777,12,"One of the reasons we dont break out the 3.3V line is that we run the main processor off that line. Since we designed nScope for students, we understand that power rails get shorted every now and then. If we broke out the 3.3V line, it would be prone to accidental hard shutdowns of the main processor, and possible damage if 5V were applied. If youd like 3.3V on the breadboard, perhaps a good way to do that is to put in your own regulator, like this one httpwww.digikey.comproductdetailenLD1117V3349714915ND586012.

For instance, in order to record the temperature every 0.1 second during a week.

135,23687165,9,"Hello everyone, I was fortunate enough to recieve a complete kit months ago, but Ive never gotten it to print and largely gave up and have ignored it for the past few months. A few of the problems Ive run into I replaced the bed with glass because the board was warped. Easy fix. One big thing is I have been completely unable to upload any new firmware to the board cause Im on a mac! and I dont fully understand the software. Im using arduino ide v0018, ponterface, and slicer. The most annoying part is the inability to get anything to stick to the bed. Tried hairspray and different tapes and Im not even sure if Im using the correct filament type. Also, every time I attempt to print, it ends with a large mass of plastic stuck inside the hot end leaving me to disassemble and clean it out each time. Latest problem is the feeder not working. I wish I could get this thing printing but lately its only annoyed me. I would love to help everyone else anyway I can, but I need help getting started too. Hopefully we can get some kind of forum or site or something to collaborate on. If anyone has any advice, Id love to hear it!!",,,,,,,,

138,23687165,11,"Thanks for your response. I really believe the basic design of this printer is a good one. I have been going over all the documentation I could find, and more would be appreciated. At this point I am mainly trying to identify hardware and havent paid much attention to softwarefirmware. When I think I have a pretty complete parts list, I will start looking into the firmware issue. I am considering putting together something, even if I dont have enough to make it fully operational yet. As I mentioned, I am new to 3d printing and I think this will be a good learning experience for me. My background is in software, although mostly application development using Java, Smalltalk and COBOL. I have started putting together a parts list broken down by each corner and It appears some of the hardware is also used by Reprap and I assumed that would be a good starting point to look at firmware needed. On the hardware front, it appears possible to tease out all the parts list from various places. I cant find the version of the specific stepper motors being used, if you could provide that it would be great, also what size is the fan and how much air does it push. I hope to at least find some sources for these types of things. After giving the documentation I have available a once over, the biggest issue to building more Maxifabs is getting all the plastic parts designed. There are only a few people out there who got a box and can do it and I really appreciate the models currently on Thingiverse, it had to take a considerable amount of time to get those ready, but only the main mounting points are there, there are a lot of other parts that would still need to be designed, I havent looked in detail, but I would guess there are at least half a dozen left to be modeled. Although, like everyone, my time has limits, I will try to do as much as I can to make this happen. And again, thanks to those of you who have put out documentation and part designs and everything else. I really appreciate it, and I am sure the other backers do too.",,,,,,,,

166,28438372,35,"Indeed. If you actually want to get very technical about the Linux CSPRNG, all three entropy pools are actually mixed with a mixing function. In the case of the input pool, the entropy count is estimated before mixing the data. The mixing function is a linear one, meaning its not a cryptographically secure function. After mixing, its placed into the input pool, and the input pool is hashed with SHA1 512bits at a time. After hashing, it is then handed off to the nonblocking and blocking entropy pools. Again, before handing off to the respective pools, the data is then mixed with the same linear mixing function again. After mixing, the hashed data is fed to the nonblocking and blocking pools, and the entropy counter is decreased as data is called on the devices, or via getrandombytes. To prevent recognizable output, the SHA1 digest is folded onto itself. The digest is 160bits, or 20bytes, or 5 words in size. The fold takes 2.5 bytes folded onto the other 2.5 bytes with a left circular shift on the last word. Only after this point, is the data delivered to the exported devices. If you want to learn more about it, you can read an excellent paper that discusses it here httpshal.inria.frfileindexdocid1005441filenameaplacharme20121.pdf or read my cliffnotes version here httpspthree.org20140721thelinuxrandomnumbergenerator",,,,,,,,

168,28438372,1,"Paul Regarding your comment to Konstantin about feeding devonerngdevice into devrandom as a way to feed the entropy pool. This is not correct. For Mac OS X, once the CSPRNG has been properly seeded, both devrandom and devurandom behave identically, using a 160bit Yarrow based on SHA1. Feeding devonerngdevice into devrandom will just force a reseed of the generator, but it wont increase the entropy estimate of the system. The BSDs use different algorithms for their CSPRNGs, but the concept is the same once seeded, they never block, devrandom or devurandom. GNULinux is different. devrandom will block when the input pool entropy estimate is low. However, feeding the OneRNG device into devrandom will not increase the input pool entropy estimate. You need to make an ioctl call for that. As such, feeding the OneRNG device into devrandom will not prevent devrandom from blocking. As such, it is recommended that you install the rngtools package, and let rngd8 make the ioctl system call based on the data it gets from the OneRNG device. , nor GNULinux. By writing your",,,,,,,,

We will probably do at least DropBox, and very likely Google Drive for cloud sync. As far as folders, we have something even better. Its called a SmartPlaylist. You can create a dynamic playlist that uses any combination of date, location and people metadata and it puts it into something like a folder. The problem with folders is that you have to manage them, but SmartPlaylists let you define what people, places and dates you want in a playlist, and as you scan more matching items, they automatically get added. For example, you can define a playlist to be photos of you and your sister in New York in 2003, and it will not only find those pictures and make them a tap away, but as you scan more in, they automatically get added.

QromaScan isnt right for this type of stuff, but later this year, will will announce a product that is specifically designed for scanning documents. It will scan single and multipage documents as easy as QromaScan does with photos, but will product PDF files instead. It will have voice recognition for tagging and organizing these PDFs, and I think it will be a great solution for backing up documents that have different properties than images. As far as Spanish support, we will support Spanish as one of our 5 languages at launch. this means that it will recognize dates and places in Spanish, and our recognition engine for recognizing proper names from you contact list should not have a problem recognizing these names.

It just makes it easier to compare things despite my local units of measure being of another unit. Ive reflowed both leaded and leadfree solder using this setup with peak temperatures of 225 and 255 degrees respectively. My oven doesnt seem to have any limits on its maximum temperature. This is an old oven I bought for 5 on Ebay a few years back. I knew I wanted to get into making my own electronics some day, so I bought the oven, but didnt use it for about 5 years until the bug finally bit me and I got started with it. At the time when I bought the oven, I didnt even consider a maximum temperature. Perhaps I was lucky in that it doesnt have a max temperature. Im curious though, even though a max temperature is specified, does it actually prevent you from achieving this by some internal safety measure or you just cant set the thermostat to regulate at that temperature On my oven, I have a toast setting that just leaves the oven on and the temperature just keeps climbing with nothing to stop it.",,,,,,,,

The delay is due to the sensor issues explained in Update 17, Busy Times. I guess it is possible that there could be another delay, but at this point we have no reason to suspect that. Right now we should be expecting most of the cameras to be ready at the end of this month. I think this team has done a fantastic job of keeping us updated regularly. Sure, sometimes the updates take a few days longer than exactly 2 weeks, but Im sure that its because theyre busy getting everything ready for the update or simply busy getting our cameras finished. Besides, they have absolutely no obligation to even keep to a strict updating scheduling outside of their own commitment to doing so. Get your heads out of your butts and read the updates which they are spending time writing and should probably be coming to your email from Kickstarter, instead of only coming to the comments and complaining about your own ignorance. The fact that were this close and only a month behind the original expected timeline is a miracle. Ive backed too many tech campaigns and theyre all waaaaaayyyyyyy far behind.

I asked it as a question at the bottom of the page so that the Q and A would be open for everyone to see like other kickstarter projects , but I guess Ill do it this way. My initial questions RPB Im a little worried about the friction of a spool on the lucite bars. I would like to see what you have designed for the horizontal version. Some of the spool loaded with filament that I have bought have flat spots on them. I hope this doesnt cause to much force needed to pull the filament especially with a full two pound spool. What is the force needed to pull a fully loaded spool both in the vertical and horizontal position Just a rough number. Answer Perception Engineering, LLC Please review update 4 for the Horizontal mount design, the changes are an additional hole in the front with plug. Also, if you have poor quality spools with flat sections this will not work properly with the Filament Safe. We will be providing quality spools on our website to help with this issue if yours have damaged flanges. Folow up RPB Repeating one of my questions, what is a rough amount of force needed to pull a full spool 1kg2.2 lbs sliding on the assumed, lucite bars. If your solution forsome flat spots on the spool is to buy your good quality spools without any flats I guess you have a good procedure to transfer filament from a poor quality spool or from air spooled filament I would be very interested in learning how to do this. Its the subject of many discussions.",,,,,,,,

And snow is less of a problem than heavy rain. But the Omnipack is rated for IPX1 which is a light rainsprinkle, and it is not recommended to take the pack in a heavy rain, but according to my experiences I have not yet had a problem.

409,81023186,44,"Since Kickstarter allows for multiple product configurations and multiple levels within each of those configurations, IMO the only practical goal criteria is total dollars. With respect to US shipping, since Kickstarter requires this to be included in the product cost it has to be treated as an overhead production cost when a project creator calculates what total funding they will need. There is a quirk, however, in that as of today there are 83 backers, yet if you add the individual pledges for all levels it adds up to only 79. Jerason Banes  I believe the project creator only noted they had to place a minimum order of 100 units for the case parts, not sell that many. And as I mentioned above, the total dollar goal is the only criteria that defines funded on Kickstarter so the product creator has to make sure that amount covers all combinations of pledge levels. Therefore, for this project 10,000 has to cover the cost of 100 cases, x Maximite circuit boards x header sets x screw sets x power supplies x component soldering labor hours and US shipping.",,,,,,,,

One backer has already set up the githup spot at httpsgithub.comscannerlumapad Hex files can be loaded via the Arduino bootloader but it takes some practice and AVR Dude to do it. I write in different compilers and use the six pin AVR ISP built into the Lumapad. No modification needed, just the 32 Atmel programmer from Digikey. I think the first step is going to be to write some Arduino code and load it up. That would make it easier for everyone to share code and come up with cool features. It would also give better access to the IMP. The IMP versions are open source because the Electric IMP is still in Beta and you need to writeload the code into your account to get it to work.

Would really appreciate if you helped me out on that. 2. I still have to pay you the shipping charges I believe but Im not sure how to do that. Please do guide me on that. 3. From where Im from, filaments are rarely available anywhere nearby here and shipping charges for a consumable end up to be quite high. Can you source like a whole bunch of extra spools of filaments I might take enough to last me a year! and I can add the cost of that into the shipping and pay you accordingly It might be a whole lot cheaper for me to do so. That and some post processingother consumables like acetoneblue painters tapeetc Do let me know  4. Initially you were not as confident about your 3D scanner system and as you said, you restricted the number so that you could work with the backers and help refine it before going mainstream.

In addition, I was wondering if an integration with a software like httpwww.photomodeler.comindex.html would be able to increase Spikes ability. Combining photo image processing and Spike. Also, how about leveraging the accelerometer and gyroscope of the phone to allow users to tilt the phone across an area to plot the raised and depressed points on the surface, combining it with photomodelers image processing capability to determine similar features in the photos taken before and after scan. A few surface scans and a few photos can then be combined and processed for a 3d model.

However, the people on kickstarter are more often than not very familiar with this process and should have experience with delays and therefore take that into account before even starting the project. If you give a date you should endeavour to stick to it, and in my experience 100 of the kickstarters that I have backed havent done this. Your metaphor just isnt relavant, do you want me to go down to their HQ and help out, just to get this thing out on time Im the consumer not the process this isnt my responsibility. Do you think that because other projects havent adhered to the given estimation date that this then becomes acceptable when further projects follow suit As a consumer you should be annoyed every time this happens, just because you have had a lot of experience with failings from project managers this doesnt mean you should grow accustomed to it! Diablo is completely unrelated, we didnt all put our money forward on the promise of a 2005 release for it to be delayed over and over again, do you honestly think that if we did, people would be Oh dont worry, its finally out now, I should just be grateful that the project manager actually got off of his arse and actually put out what he promised to all those years ago. Of course we wouldnt, there would be outrage and you know it.

Any contamination from brass alloys without intentional Pb content will be extremely low and certainly overtaken by the intrinsic contaminations of food grade materials.

In other words they have already succeeded. My guess would be they are simply using Kickstarter to generate funds and to gauge product response. Probably to ditch loans as well. Its a great resource. I bought my first PLX product before Kickstarter was even a thing. But after the piss poor customer relations myself and others have gotten Ill never buy anything from them ever again. They keep telling us to contact their support. I contacted them twice, zero response. Even when I had an issue many years ago with an ODBC product their support was horrible. That should have told me something then, but I always give a second chance. Never a third. As for my meter, the more I play around with it the more it doesnt work. I have to constantly unplug it and plug it back in to get it to turn on. with zero response from support I guess Ill have to wait until this goes on sale with Amazon.

501,99286835,1,"The trim pots are DigiKey pn TS53YL1.0KCTND. Right now the PID coefficients are constants in the code, plus a Psquared one. Long story. You need to write a capture loop of the potentiometer values through the analog inputs. The way to tune the parameters is to start with all three at zero, increase P until there is some oscillation, then scale back a bit. Then increase D until there is no more oscillation. You can then add some I empirically. It is a very iterative, backandforth process. The Psquared is more or less like P, but gives more robustness when recovering from large tilting angles. Thats the theory. In practice you can spend a great many hours doing just that tuning.",,,,,,,,

535,107206217,16,"I received my Mibo Plus in Philadelphia today. First, I believe some parts are missing You wrote in update 19 We changed name mibo to mibo kit. Every kit includes a mibo top one lense, a mibo top double lense, a mibo mini  a single sticky lens for sticking to your phone camera, a separate light source and other parts. Every mibo backer will receive this kit. mibo backers will receive this kit too, except mibo top part. I received two lenses to push into the holes but no sticky lens and no light source. Also, two blank slides but no specimens. I have no idea whether the two lenses I did receive our the Mibo plus magnification or, given the other things missing, whether I simply receive the Mibo basic. Second, about the construction In the end video it looks like the pieces snap together and hold together but my pieces fit so loosely that they fall apart and require a rubber band to hold them together. Is there any suggestion to make them stick without rubber bands Could you send me the things that were missing Thank you",,,,,,,,

542,109042333,5,"Hi Margaux Gilbert and Clyde Dugosh 1 What are your printing conditions, what printer settings are you using  To Help Resolve your issue with Polyflex we suggest you try use a lower printing speed. The general printing speeds we recommend are between 45  60mms but your your case you can try 30mms. Another issue could be with the printing temperature. PolyFlex is not like regular PLA based materials which has a wide spectrum of printing temperatures between 190  240 Degree Celsius. PolyFlex in fact has a narrow spectrum between 220 230 Degree Celsius. So please ensure the temperatures is within these values, possibly closer to the 230 mark. 2 What type of extruder is your printing equipped with  With all Direct Drive Extruders, we have tested, we have not come up with any issues that have or can not be resolved, either 1.75mm or 3mm. Bowden type extruders tho are more difficult for flexible type filaments. With almost all flexible materials there is a common physical property, which is a rubberlike surface texture. Because of this surface texture the main issue comes from the Bowden tubes position, an arch like shape. This mean that the driving force must force the filament up the tube before it travels down the tube and into the extruder. When the filament is traveling up the tube to the top of the arch a lot of friction is created between the inner tube and the filament. We are currently working to resolve this problem but unfortunately we do not have any solution at this moment. This problem may not effect all printers with a Bowden type extruder but it has been noted with those whos Bowden guide tube travels in an upward arch position. I hope that has helped shed some light on the issue. If you have any more questions please just private message us and we will do our best to help resolve the issue for you. Cheers, Aaron",,,,,,,,

It is possible the the wheel turning incorrectly is a minor problem between different compilers used  and if so it will be fixable but just might take a little time. In the mean disabling the rotary encoders will be your best bet. If after managing to get it to go in a straight line it then over or under turns, then you can adjust that with the turn calibration.

701,139868488,422,"As much as I would like the Memoto in its present form to succeed, Im starting to have serious doubts. I wrote in previous comments that I strongly believe that wireless communication to a smart phone or tablet are in my view essential to such a wearable camera. I also wrote that a wide angle lens is highly desirable. Yesterday I found out about another wearable life logging camera that is in the make, while leafing through the last UK edition of WIRED magazine. Have a look at the Autographer from UK company OMG. httpwww.autographer.com It proves that there is a new genre of small wearable cameras coming to the market for a public that is not only interested in extreme sports recording but also in life logging applications. The Memoto with its design, features and form factor is certainly a good candidate to become part of this new breed of cameras but in my opinion, in order to succeed it must have in build features like wireless comms to phones and tablets and take images in a resolution and angle that will allow the user to really place him or herself back in the past scene and take pics from odd angles that come from clipping on a camera.

For example, on my daily commute, I may often see the same things every day, so the standard 30 second interval is sufficient.

830,183541113,231,"Guys, I apologize I thought that I read it was 12 by 12 I guess it must have been from an article outside of Kickstarter and I mixed things up. I was asking to see the autolevel probe, because theres been a lot of projects saying one thing and then failing to deliver. My whole point is if its that simple why not show it Telling me its so simple that its not even worth showing and then referring me to a YouTube video doesnt exactly convince me. So here is something thats been bugging me I woke up yesterday morning and found out about this new BI V2.0 delta printer which is in the same price range as yours httpwww.kickstarter.comprojects1784037324biv20aselfreplicatinghighprecision3dprinte This new printer differs in some ways, but offers a lot of powerful options and Im just trying to decide where I will invest, because I will only be getting one delta style printer. Understandably, I want the most for my money. Heres the thing I recently backed the GMAX printer and now that Ive received it and had ample time to print with it I have more experience with the Kickstarter process and 3D printing in general. I really like the fact that Im able to use many materials and upgrade to dual extrusion with my GMAX and I dont want to lose these features with my next printer. With that in mind, I have a few important questions for you Is there any way that your printer will be able to support ABSNylonLaywoodFlexible filament etc in the future With only 60 Watts of power can we even heat the hotend to a temperature that would support ABS I havent seen any pictures of the electronics board  Will that electronics package support a heat bed upgrade or multiple extrusion in the future if so when Ive also been following the PICO project  What if id like to install the new PICO hotend onto the deltaprintr Just being a bit of a devils advocate here but this new V2.0 printer offers a 350W PSU, heat bed and multiple extrusion capabilities and you could print other copies of it I dont personally care about that feature, but its cool  I could print one for my cousin. Another big factor is that they will be shipping earlier. Im just thinking that everyone is moving towards newer high temperature materials, multiple extrusions etc. Im afraid that by the time I receive the Deltaprintr, it will already be irrelevant. Any chance we can see an earlier delivery window",,,,,,,,
831,183541113,17,"As requested, I have contacted you through Kickstarter message. I have paid for my kit and for the international shipping fee, but no one has gotten back to me.

Heres a couple pics of the finished unit... httpsplus.google.comJeffCrillypostsV4GR3AdyZii Btw, getting the Smart Nixies in the case was a bit tight.. it turned out some of the excess soldered leads needed more trimming.

883,194727834,56,"Hello, looking forward to this. Is there actually a way to use the touchboard as a feedback device on rightwrong in a child questionnaire type situation. Meaning I touch a question and must touch the right answer. As an example I would have a face and the word nose beside it. So one touches the nose in the face and the word and the audio response would be nose. As you mentioned uses of double sensors circuits to cover an whole alphabet couldnt a similar double trigger be used but spread apart so the interaction uses two touch points Looking forward on to a short assessment ",,,,,,,,
884,194727834,53,"About the double sensor circuit, just curious would this work. Have 3 different sections which use proximity sensors to detect which section the hand is in. In those three sections you would reuse the 9 left over sensors as AI, JR, SZ. These sensors would have a higher touch sensitivity and would need direct contact. It would limit it to one person use at a time.",,,,,,,,

886,195225878,13,"Excellent questions, Casey. The payload container itself will be milled out of dense styrofoam. We just purchased a Canon A800 10MP digital camera to take the stills, and we also just purchased a Kodak Z6, I believe, to film in HD. The Arduino flight computer will have control over the two temperature sensors one inside the payload container and one outside. Also, the Arduino flight computer will gather data from a GPS module and a light sensor. If we have the time and funding to do it, were thinking seriously about incorporating a pressure sensor INSIDE the balloon. The data we collect will help us do extended, overnight balloon flights in the future! All of the data captured by the Arduino flight computer will get beamed down to earth so well know where the balloon and payload are, and whats going on up there! Lets hope we get to do this part! We still need funding for the radio equipment! OHABs team members are all in it for different reasons, so I cant say that were strictly in it for one thing or another. Thats whats beautiful about this project! By contributing to this project, you are not just helping the team, youre helping at least one team member achieve a personal goal!

978,213122431,45,What are your thoughts on regenerative braking What type of charger will be included is it portable enough to carry with you on a mountain bike,,,,,,,,
979,213122431,44,"Hey Chris, Generally speaking Im a fan of regenerative braking, though the amount of energy you get back is fairly small as compared to other electric vehicles. This is largely due to the fact that bikes are so lightweight, which means there isnt as much kinetic energy to recapture. Interestingly, the larger the rider, the more energy you can get back with regen brakes. In addition to energy conversion, regen brakes are also nice because they add some extra braking power. However, regen braking is only possible on ebikes with gearless motors, which are much larger, heavier motors. Gearless motors are always turning, either because they are powering the bike while the throttle is activated, or because they are being forced to spin while the bike is coasting. This can be annoying because when you want to pedal, youre having to work extra hard to spin the motor as well. Geared motors, like the ones in my kit, are designed to freewheel when the bike is coasting or when you are pedaling. This means there is no extra rolling resistance from the motor. The tradeoff is that you cant use regenerative braking because the motor isnt actually turning unless power is applied. Its a world of compromises, but I went with comfortease of use at the expense of adding regenerative braking. The charger is a ventilated metal bodied charger, not a plastic dinky one. Its still pretty small, about 1.5x3x7, just a bit bigger than a laptop charger. When I want to bring it with me on my mountain bike I usually put it in a bag on my handlebars. My wifes bike has a basket so shes put it there, or puts it in her backpack if her basket is off. Most of the time I dont bring the charger though  only if I know a trip is going to be more than 20 miles or if I forgot to charge after my last ride. I see you figured out the pledge for the kits for you and your wife. Im sure you guys are going to love your ebikes my wife and I sure do!",,,,,,,,

Can anyone here besides myself remember when Christopher Price said some things about the technical aspects of Console OS, misquoted or misinterpreted a few key points, and the engineering team had to step in and write in his place Just go back a few hundred comments or so and you will find it, where the engineering team said they were speaking and were clarifying on a few points. Also dig in deep on Google and look for, if I remember right, the Intel IDF convention video where Chippy from UMPC Portal interviews Christopher Price, where further proof of more staff is evidenced in the dialogue. When Chippy asks about a specific thing, Price cannot said much more on account that he would get in trouble with the engineering staff. Based on these two occasions, it is crystal clear that there is no charade or masquerade but there are multiple people hard at working squashing bugs and programming Console OS. Besides, the actual honesttogoodness reason Price is being secretive about his other staff is, several months ago, some boneheads at, if I recall correctly, XDA Developers decided to threaten his team for not giving them what they wanted, all when they hadnt even backed the Console OS, expecting something for nothing. XDA Developers has its dark side of knuckleheads who think they have the right to stalk, harass and defame ambitious, talented people as if it were a fanciful pastime or some fun sport of wits. Back when moderation at XDA Developers was hit and miss at best, I recall of many a independent project in the heyday of Windows Mobile getting openly attacked and ultimately extinguished on account of the offenses of big, socalled widely lauded forum members there. In outright opposition to these projects, these members posted illegal copies of software, listed personal information of developers and made blatant libel which was obviously ludicrous. Some of these members even had the gall to call a project founder racist just because it is a simple and easy way to get many people against a good person and a great project, and many people in forums fell for it like those in the witch hunts of centuries past did. More rational, logical thinking and a good deal of patience will save us from plenty of emotional outbursts and burnt bridges and, as a result, let the Console OS team focus solely on owning up to their product and giving us answerswhich, as the last update clearly demonstrates, they are already busily doing. And since the hardware vendors are being just as slow and stupid with the Console OS team as they have been with their own product lines in bringing proper Lollipop support, everyone needs to sit tight and chill and listen to Console OSs new strategy. Bringing the community to work on the project in is a superb idea, one bound to give the hardware vendors just enough pressure and maybe even embarassment to nudge them in doing with their paid employees what the community can do gratis anyway. Just as the Console OS team said in their own update, not one penny has been used from our precious donations yet to fund their programming, and, holding them to their word, lets wait before and see how this pans out. Per the recommendation in the comment area here, the Console OS team needs our confidence through us cheering them on and being respectful and considerate to them just as much as we need them and their product to move forward and become what Console OS had set out to be.",,,,,,,,

1011,217700140,9,"Hi danijel, First off, thanks for backing us! In answer to your question, the tower uses a energy efficient 16W pump that can either run continuously or on a timer. If youre interested in saving some money on electricity, a timer can turn the pump on for 10 minutes on the hour, only during the day. This will reduce the amount of electricity being consumed considerably. Ive built passive models before, using gravity feed tanks, but the problem with them is that water is very heavy and building the structure and support necessary to hold that weight up is costprohibitive. Also, you end up using energy to pump water up to the canister anyway. This holds true for water holding growth media as well, making it necessary to install expensive structural support to hold up something that is mostly waterweight. What Ive found in my research is that by focussing on media materials that dont hold as much water, and replacing the cost of infrastructure with extra pumping energy, you can reduce costs and make a product thats much more user friendly and adoptable. . . I know, a long drawn out answer for a simple question, but thats what Ive discovered. Thanks for your support danijel! I really appreciate you backing us!",,,,,,,,

Not to say you wont see the functionality down the road. Gareth. There are certain preprogrammed messages low battery being one of them that will be stored in memory.

1022,221612736,12,"First off, congratulations Eric  this is lovely. Second, a little discourse on freedom and economy, inspired by some of the previous comments. A guy trying to put bread on his table doing what he wants to do and does well is not going to take anyones cherished freedom away. The whole concept of freedom is based upon voluntary economic transactions between sovereign individuals which in plain English means pay for it if you want to, dont pay if you dont. If people stopped receiving and paying money for goods and services, the economy or rather, what is left of it would cease to function entirely, and with it human progress itself. That is why I categorically reject the idea that Eric should release his videos for free. In fact, I believe that by releasing them as commercial product, he creates MORE freedom and prosperity in the world, and heres why Rich Hickey, Phil Hagelberg, and others release their videos for free because they have other sources of income thats their choice. Thats FREEDOM. At the same time, there are developers who choose to sell their educational work Gary Bernhardt, Avdi Grimm, Ryan Bates, Geoffrey Grosenbach, and many others. Again, FREEDOM at work. You as a consumer are then FREE to choose should you give your money to Ryan or Gary or should you watch a free one by Rich or Phil. Or both  as I do. Noone is worse off than they were before, but somebody Ryan or Gary may have made some money good for them! and somebody like myself has gotten exactly what they want. FREEDOM. Gotta love it. And by the way, if anyone is concerned about preserving freedom, pick a fight that matters httpswww.eff.org httpwww.fightforthefuture.org Please lets get rid of the notion that we live in a free world whose freedom is threatened by people who want to get paid for what they love doing. Its the other way around. We live in an increasingly unfree world, and entrepreneurs are one of the forces that help keep it free.  James",,,,,,,,

Ive never used that particular plugin but have now put it on the list of thingstotry, sounds interesting. In terms of streaming to GRBL, the only real requirement is that whatever program you choose, sends one line then waits for the OK send back from GRBL before sending the next. This is to prevent overrunning the tiny arduino buffer. You may also want to look into Highlander01s python based front end, It works swimmingly on ubuntu but Ive never checked it on OS X. httpsgithub.comHighlander01Highlander01HMI As far as plotting definitely!

They worked on the project, but were not able to deliver working software. Only my son and me were left holding the bag. This project was too ambitious at the time of this kickstarter, we learned.

We want Bluwire to be a device that people use legally. There are two primary laws concerning the recording audio. One Party Consent Laws This is federal law and the law in 38 states. You can record a phone call or conversation so long as you are a party to the conversation. Furthermore, if you are not a party to the conversation, a oneparty consent law will allow you to record the conversation or phone call so long as your source consents and has full knowledge that the communication will be recorded. Two Party Consent Laws Twelve states require the consent of every party to a phone call or conversation in order to make the recording lawful California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington. Although they are referred to as twoparty consent laws, consent must be obtained from every party to a phone call or conversation if it involves more than two people. In addition it is important to note a general trend in privacylegality in public Privacy Expectation Generally speaking, however, you will not be liable for intrusion if you photograph or capture video of people in public places, even if they have not consented to being recorded, because individuals cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy when in public.

All phones with Bluetooth support the amp as an output for all applications. That means you can use the native player apps, Pandora, Youtube, Netflix  you name the application and it will work for audio right out of the box. DLNA requires a dedicated app.",,,,,,,,
1157,246620514,1,"Here are a few tips for resolving problems with dropped audio 1. Make sure the phone volume is turned all the way up. Use the knob on the amp to adjust the volume. 2. Close any applications you arent using, too many apps can cause the Bluetooth audio to drop out. On an iPhone, double click the main button to see all the running apps. Swipe up on any apps you arent currently using to stop them and free processing resources. 3. If you are still experiencing problems, you can check the audio signal strength by putting the BluAmp into VU meter mode. This is a sweet feature of the amp that most people dont know about.

The whole point of me backing this project was that I would have this product much earlier than anything from the larger companies. You guys are going to get crushed by the larger companies since, seemingly, the only advantage you have is possibly being first to market the features youre offering are not superior and no one knows who you are. If you wont get the product out for us backers, do yourselves a favor and get it out ASAP so you can have a hope at taking any of the market.",,,,,,,,

My remaining confusion is that its not clear to me what the geckotek sheet materials properties are and how you expect it to be stacked with other bed components. How thick is the geckotek sheet material How flexible If thin and flexible, should it be adhered to a stiffer substrate with 3M 9474LE or equivalent If so, will the geckotek come with an adhesive layer on the back My existing print bed is 3mm borosilicate glass clipped over a permanently mounted aluminum heat spreader with a 120W kapton adhered to the underside.

1210,257294616,1,"Hi Scott Thanks for your comments. 1 Ive tested both relays on mains ranging from 40W60W lamps, my switching digital power supply, my bass amp, and my old CRT TV. No issues. Ripping up the traces, while up to you, shouldnt be necessary at all. 2 Changing the resistor value for the LEDs is again up to you. Using the larger resistor isnt a bad idea. However,If they are too bright at 470R, then an option would to be only to use them during test. That is what they are for. Test, then remove the LEDEN jumper. The Cheat of using one resistor for two LEDs is something that I would do for two different types of LEDs, but with lots and lots of experience with these specific 3mm LEDs, it has never been a problem. Adding a resistor for each and ripping up the board apart for it, while up to you, is a waste of time. Respectfully. 3 Up to you, but again, ripping up the board for this reason is again, not necessary. This board requires next to no power when in normal operation LEDs offRelays off. Even when they are on, Ive tested the living heck out of this unit. Ripping it apart for these reasons is completely unnecessary. As for the white foam. That is the same foam that Ive been using for many years to ship processors and ICs of the like. If is the same foam used by my manufacturer to ship ASYs. The same foam used to ship ICs and processors in my last two kickstarters. Ive been told by the manufacturer that it is ESD protective. In any case, it has never once caused an issue. At least not one that Im aware of. You make some solid points, and thank you for them, but for a small unit such as this, they shouldnt cause any issues. If anyone has any issue with anything, please send me a message and Ill get back to you. Thanks Pat",,,,,,,,

We have a manufacturer partner who makes a really durable Polyurethane screen protector that is formable, and resists scratches, and damage. We were going to use the material for clear skins, but it would make a good screen protector as well! Ryan the main portion of the glass would still be covered, but those edges with the extra curvature might still be a tricky part to cover. We will know more once we have our 3D printed Pebbles and the actual ones in our hands though. We have a manufacturer who could possibly make an already curved glass that is not flexible, this process would be very costly though. it is one of our backup plans if needed There should be little to no gaps on the Pebble Time though.",,,,,,,,

Guys like you that have the project ideas will be able to push what creations are available using Open Rail. In the example SketchUp file that we uploaded to Thingiverse, we only had a few examples from a few distributors. I think theres going to be a lot more interesting designs showing up utilizing some of the unique profiles that are available. One of the added benefits we foresee is the ability to adjust Open Rail in areas where the extrusion itself may show deflection over a long distance. This could be measured along the length with a dial indicator to make sure its perfect. Just an idea, for now. Well have to put this one to the test but it seems feasible. Thank you so much!

1300,271244061,17,"Why am I not surprised by the lack of professionalism. This is not how a project creator is supposed to act, especially in reaction to someone that trusted you, and provided you with 5000 to get your project off the ground. What troubles me the most is that you continue to post libelous statements toward me that have absolutely no basis on fact, nor anything to do with your failure on this project. Several statements you have made here are false, and can be easily proven by reading our public correspondence. You in fact did refuse to deliver my rewards, and you failed to issue me a refund by my due date. Which was very generous in fact. Your claim that you made me several offers immediately after discovering the shortage is incorrect. You were aware for months before you were forced to tell me you oversold the MIGHTY boards. The fact is, you had enough to cover me and all the other Kickstarter backers, but sold the boards to other people starting in December. You received the boards in November, and had full knowledge of the shortage well before you made offers in March. In March. You didnt tell me right away either. You told me I was only going to get 25 boards. That wasnt an offer, and it certainly was not 50 like you keep claiming. When I refused to accept anything less than exactly what I paid you for, you did bump it up to 50. I wasnt happy and asked for my full 100, and you finally dropped the bombshell that you didnt have enough boards. It was at that time I gave you the ultimatum of 100 boards or my 5000 refunded by May 18th 2013. You took the refund route and took my boards fully off the table. Refusal to ship my rewards. Of course at this time, you had only shipped around 20 boards. You still had approximately 130 boards in your possession, which still would have been enough to cover all Kickstarter backers including myself. You choose to not only sell more boards before the Kickstarter backers got anything, you took those boards away from me and other Kickstarter backers, and sent them out to nonKickstarter customers BEFORE Kickstarter backers got their product. Your claim that I said you were telling customers their packages were lost and your computer was broken is false. It did not occur the way you are claiming. I only posted that you were claiming packages were getting lost at the post office, and that your main computer had died. These are both true statements. Youre trying to spin it to make it seem like I was saying you were telling customers these things directly. That is not true. Therefore it is a false statement, and you wont find a customer to come forward to tell something that didnt happen that way regardless. This is just you trying to spin truths, and trying to draw attention away from the real issue at hand. According to what you just said. 59 Proton Pack kits have shipped, and 25 more will be shipping soon, for a total of 84. Thats pretty fantastic. But when I look at the Kickstarter page, I see only 22 backers that purchased a Proton Pack kit. Why are 84 kits being shipped when only 22 were sold here What about the Predator kits, the Ghost Trap kits, and more importantly the self programmable bare bones MIGHTY kits you sold When do those other 14 backers get what they paid for And more importantly. Why are you selling kits to other people that werent involved with the Kickstarter, and shipping those out first From my calculations, you sold approximately 140 MIGHTY boards here on Kickstarter, ordered 150, but have sold an additional 62 on top of what was paid for by Kickstarter backers. Where are these new boards coming from Thats right. Its coming out of the 16k backed here on Kickstarter. If I am owed 100 boards, I doubt Im the only one left out here. Again. I do not believe it is very professional of you to try to drag my name through the mud with your libelous statements about me. I too am a Kickstarter Project Creator. I have run two successful projects that yielded very good results. They were not without their speed bumps... but I communicated with my backers every step of the way. This project here has been without any actual updates for a long time. And here.. youve had the circuit boards for over 6 months now. Now Im not upset by the fact that you gave a ship date of August and didnt actually get things out until March the following year. You seem to be making that claim a lot in regard to me being impatient or upset about the project being late. My Kickstarter project heck most Kickstarter projects are not able to maintain the timeline they originally set out with. Im certainly no stranger to that. What I did though is keep my backers updated every step of the way, even while setbacks were occurring. You told me privately that you did not believe you had to keep your backers informed of any problems at all. Look at where that got you. You dont seem to be able to understand the difference between a large project like I had with hundreds of individual parts, some totaling into the hundreds of dollars each, vs. your electronics project. I put 20 hours of my own hands on physical labor into each and every CNC machine I made, in addition to the time the CNCs were making themselves, parts were cooling.. etc. You hired someone off shore to do your work for you, and didnt have a tested prototype at the time of ordering your production run. I had legitimate and documented setbacks and delays which altered the shipping schedule for some backers, but not all. The time line you are claiming I fulfilled my rewards in is not accurate at all. Your example of elbow pads is laughable at best. Are you honestly telling me that those 15 minutes per week I spent sending an email to a sporting goods factory should be a cause for alarm that I wasnt working hard enough on my project I was also working a full time job, and I managed to get the project done as quickly as I did. You do not have a job, and really have no excuse for not working on your project at least a few hours every day. Again. Your libelous statement toward me, someone who gave you 5000 for your project, is very unprofessional. You received approximately 150 boards in November. Enough for the approximately 140 you owed as a result of Kickstarter. Rather than ship the boards, you began selling more boards in December and the following months. Several months later, you tell me you dont have enough to ship to me, and leave me with empty promises. This is not a matter of me being impatient as you claim. This is fully fledged fraud and misappropriation of funds.",,,,,,,,
1301,271244061,18,"It is true that AJ Quick contributed 5,000 to this project in exchange for 100 of my boards and that he has not yet received a reward or a refund. It is not true that I refused to deliver his reward or refund his money. When I discovered I would not have enough boards to fill AJs order, I made him several offers. I offered to ship him 50 boards immediately, and the rest when I was able to do a second run. I offered to repay him over a reasonable period of time. I offered him 35 proton pack kits worth over 5,000. He refused all of these offers, and rather than attempt any negotiation he immediately threatened to sue me if I did not come up with 5,000 in two months. He then banned me from selling on his forum, cutting off my primary source of income and making it impossible to even begin repaying him. From there he launched a campaign of misinformation and lies, telling my other customers that I had sold their kits out from under them, and that they should demand refunds and initiate paypal disputes. Finally, he added me to his list of blacklisted sellers, where he continued to mislead people by telling them that I had told my customers my computer was broken and that their packages had been lost in the mail. The majority of what hes said however is provably false. He will not be able to bring forth a single customer who will testify that I told them their kit had been lost in the mail or that their kit would be late because my computer was broken. And, as of today I have shipped 59 proton pack kits, and the last 25 that were ordered are boxed up and ready to go out the door. So everything he told my customers about how they would not get what they paid for has also been revealed to be a lie. At this point I would like to direct you to AJ Quicks own Kickstarter campaigns httpwww.kickstarter.comprojectsajquickmodulardesktopcncmachine httpwww.kickstarter.comprojectsajquickcncbuildingblocks If you read the comment sections, you will see that his CNC machines were to be delivered in May, but it was not until November that the last of them arrived on peoples doorsteps... six months late. Then, in his second campaign he specified a delivery date of May, but the parts werent delivered until the following March... a full 10 months late, and a year after his campaign ended. So when AJ says he gave me a year to deliver his kits, keep in mind that he himself took a year to deliver products to others, and he had a lot more money to work with. Also, while I was working full time on my project, something he seems to believe was unscrupulous, he delivered his product late because he spent his time running his Ghostbusters website and designing elbow pads instead of finishing the products others had paid for httpwww.gbfans.comcommunityviewtopic.php Note the date July 2012  He started working on elbow pads three months after he should have delivered the CNC building blocks, and four months before he finished them. In summary, AJ Quick is the real con artist here, and he is upset because I did not have his product ready when he wanted it to be ready. There is no fraud on a massive scale as he has made there out to be. If there were, this forum would be full of people complaining about not having received their kits, like his. I have a few Predator Kits which I still need to deliver, but those are being worked on, and all the backers who bought Proton Pack kits, save AJ, have received them.",,,,,,,,

1303,271244061,19,"A year has now past since this Kickstarter project was fully funded. I backed 5000, yes FIVE THOUSAND dollars, in an agreement with Shawn Swift for 100 barebones MIGHTY kits. I discussed the development extensively and was lead to believe the project would go through as expected. Several months after the funding of the Kickstarter, Shawn contacted me and asked that I just toss another 5000 his way for more boards. I refused. Later in the year, I found that Shawn Swift began selling extra MIGHTY kits. Turns out these extra kits were the kits that I paid for. At Shawns own admission this was because he had spent the money he received from the Kickstarter for his living expenses. He needed to begin selling my boards to others because he again needed the money for his personal living expenses, and after 9 months of development the project was still not done. On March 21st, 2013. Shawn Swift refused to ship my MIGHTY kits, despite having them in hand. He informed me that I would be receiving a refund instead of the kits an agreement I fully accepted, and agreed to. According to the Kickstarter Terms of Service, I am to be issued that refund if the project creator is unable or unwilling to provide a reward. I provided Shawn Swift until May 18th 2013 exactly 1 year since the Kickstarter was funded to issue that refund. Five days until the deadline, Shawn publically refused to issue me a refund. We are now 12 days since that deadline has passed and Shawn Swift has made no attempt to issue that refund, or provide any kind of reparation. I am now working on taking action against Shawn Swift. I know Im not the only one out there that has not received what they paid for here on Kickstarter in regard to Shawn Swift.

Lets just say the material is very rough and has a lot of room for sidebar education.. like the concept for longitude and latitude measuring system being developed in the third century BC. I started doing some proofingupdating about two hours ago thinking I could clean it up quick.It needs help. What do I mean by sidebar The meat of the document should be cover the important concepts.

Weve had experience with the ShapeOko 2, Handibot and other CNCs in the past but this machine is in a different class.

1368,286124171,10,"Hey Eric, The machine can technically operate like that, however when it comes to safety and avoiding damage to the machine it would be best not to. The reason being is if you need to hit the emergency stop button for whatever reason, it will cut power to the entire machine, which would cause the gantry to slide all the way down to the bottom and smashing into the front end plates. If you put rubber bumpers in the way you could lower the risk of damage if you do end up setting the machine vertically, but I would avoid doing so simply for safety reasons. You could maybe set the machine up at a very slight angle to encourage the cutting fluid to drain in a particular direction if your design calls for it, but going full vertical or near vertical is not advisable. Best, Louis",,,,,,,,
1369,286124171,22,"Douglas Cheever Thanks for backing our project and for your questions! I see that both Tom and Bert have pretty much answered everything big thanks to you guys, but to elaborate further as far as clamping material down is concerned, many people end up putting thread inserts into the wasteboard which allows them to screw down clamps throughout the board where needed. Also you can substitute the supplied MDF wasteboard with tslot extrusions. This will allow you to slide clamps to any part of the table which can come in handy. The SD full kit does come with the software to run it, but you will need to use another program to design parts and another to generate the Gcode for the Routakit SD to read. We use VCarve Pro, it allows us to draw our parts and generate the Gcode all in one place, which is really convenient, but there are many other options to choose from as well, some of which are free. As far as tolerance you can expect everything to be within .005, were consistently seeing those numbers with our testing, though if you slow the cut rate down a bit its not a stretch to get numbers closer to .001.002.",,,,,,,,

We will look at your data soon and respond with some answers! ali your S4 mini does not support USB hosting, so thats why it is not functioning on that particular device and is working correctly on your friends phones. The S3 is an ongoing issue and appears to be a Samsung hardware problem that only affects certain S3s. Bobby nope your DrinkMate should be just fine! It might need a little extra time to clear out the alcohol, though, but the app should let you know how much time it needs  Drar ls that is strange! We will send you a direct message so we can figure out why you are getting those readings Alx0363  enjoy and be safe!  Dennis Thompson so good to hear! Weve been working hard to make sure the app accounts for so many small differences in all the sensors. Joe Freund yes we are definitely changing that soon. Thank you for the feedback! joergy thank you for the great feedback! Were working hard to make sure everyone has a DrinkMate that works as well as yours! Harpdoc the recommended operating range as per the instruction manual is 50 degrees F  104 degrees F. Leaving it in a cold or hot car should not damage anything, but in order to ensure proper functionality, your DrinkMate will indeed need to return to a temperature in the operating range prior to use. Also, if moisture is left inside the sensor e.g. from a previous use, that moisture could damage the sensor if it freezes, so thats something to consider. antonino schillaci please see our direct message so we can figure out why you are getting these readings. Glensy Frederick your Droid RAZR does not support USB hosting, so DrinkMate will not be able to receive power and work with your phone.

Jayster review On the positive side and only positive side, it works fine when my iPhone 5 is not on silent and the Jayster is at a particular distance from my iPhone 5, my iPhone 5 chirps like a bird. On the downside, I have issues that needs to be said. 1 At first I had to keep scanning for a nearby Jayster on my iPhone 5 even though I put the Jayster on top or below my iPhone until it locates. Even when my iPhone locates the Jayster and I hit the connect, it still doesnt connect until after 2  3 tries, 2 as recommended, to activate the nest button, the Jayster be next to the device which I did. The problem with it is when I have my iPhone 5 is in the holster and the Jayster is not even a foot away, it chirps and the app says the Jayster is out of distance and 3 there are times when I have to put my iPhone on silent. Only the Jayster beeps when its at a distance from my iPhone and the pitch is not loud enough in a crowded place. Too bad theres no option to change the volume and that there was an option to have the Jayster chirp on the iPhone even though it is on silent. Does the Jayster work on IR Bluetooth My bluetooth earpiece works better than the Jayster. After approximately 10 feet, my Bluetooth headset tells me that my earpiece is disconnected from my iPhone. Please dont misunderstand me. I look forward to great inventions but these issues should have been corrected before being sent out. Overall, not too pleased with this device. I was going to give this to a friend as a Christmas gift but since this was sent after the holidays, it was going to be a belated Christmas gift anyway since she keeps loosing her keys and her iPhone but with these issues, I dont want her to deal with these issues.

1466,304183997,10,"Hi Rob, This is more of a digital shield with some analog pins. So 64 digital plus 8 analog. You want something that is purely analog. There are two way to get extra analog pins Expensive way is to get I2C analog ICs they are about 6GBP per 16 pin IC. that would cost you 75GBP per 240 pins. Less expensive bit more complicated way is to use multiplexers they are alot cheaper 0.30p per 16 inuputs, but they need digital pins to control them and use of anlog pins to multiplex. Making it very complex if you need 240 inputs. You can connect to of my shields and it will give you 128 digital plus 16 analog pins.But its not really what you want.

BTW thanks for the extra mm header strip because I screwed up putting the first one in upside down and wrecked it removing it. I have a couple of assembly notes, suggestions and questions. These are fairly moot because Im guessing almost everyone has gotten their boards and assembled them, but for future versions and future projects you should please keep these ideas in mind. And maybe others are confused on one point or another and this might help. ...analogmultiplexer library. Ill try to work on this the coming week, but if you will mange to make it work yourselves let me know. Im more hardware than software kinda guy. Thats a little out of my league. Im a translate engineerthinkspeak into something mere mortals can understand kinda guy.  These notes are all Re Update 13. Since you didnt number the pics I referenced them by counting from the top andor quoting text. 1 First problem is that the photos you took are clear but TERRIBLE technique. That backlit look makes visibility very difficult. 2 Detail. R3 and R4 legends are under the parts. 3 Assembly. Parts should be assembled in order from shortest to tallest, and where theres a choice from inwards to outwards. Resistors first The 8 mm headers down the center The edge mf and mm headers The power connector Last is the LM317 The reason is that when you flip the board over on a flat surface to solder, the parts dont fall out. Yes resistors can have their leads bent but that makes any removereplace later much more difficult. I prefer to never bend any leads unless absolutely necessary. 4 My only serious concern about anything was orientation for the LM317. I dont know what the penalty might be for wiring it backwards. The only pic that shows it is 5. Im 99.9999 sure the tab should face outwards. I hate being even that tiny  unsure. OK so Im 100 sure because the orientation can be inferred by the light coming through the mounting hole, but someone else might not be. 5 Pic 4 resistors. Instead of describing assembly in paragraph format, the correct way to do it is a list R1 220 ohm R2 720 ohm R3 4.7k R4 4.7k I had to rererereread that text to make SURE I got it right. For example the second sentence the words R1 and 720 ohm appear right next to each other. The words 220 and R1 are actually separated by 4 words. Its a visually confusing way to describe a technical aspect. 6 Pic 5 says that a jumper sets the board address, and 03 or 47. But it doesnt say which position is which. Further, I glanced at the library code and see the variable IOAddress but I have no idea how to relate that binary number to anything. The point is fairly moot because the default library address and the jumper as shown in the pic worked. I think there should be another commented out line in the library to define the other address, and a little more text that describes what that address meansdoes. 7 Pic 6 is fabulously confusing..... 7a The text mentions mux. The whole board is a mux. In fact its two muxes.  That word does not appear in the github distribution files. A google search for sitekickstarter.comprojectsmantaspats64ioarduinoshield mux returns two hits  the update page, and your credits page. Inferred temporary solution where you said one of the analog pins I got the impression that this is meant for the analog mux So, I left that wire out for now. 7b The text says a wire. The legend labeled MUX is next to a box with two pads in it. The pic circles one pad, implying that thats the one to use. Whats the other for, if anything 7c In the pic the red lines are confusing, if taken at face value. Theres one line from the circle around the MUX pad, that goes to A2. Theres another doublearrow line that appears to go behind that first line, from A0 to A4. Now I dont think thats what you meant to say visually, or to tie 3 address pins together, but that is what those lines halfimply. Regardless of the text saying one one wire. 7d The text says ...UNO ...do not use A4. Yet, one of those lines goes to A4. Again I know thats not what you meant, but JoeJoelle Newbie might have a bunch of difficulty with it. That whole pic, the lines and text, there are only a few ways to drawdescribe what to do, otherwise its unclear and confusing to the average moderately technical user.  Two details about the sample code. I suggest that the delay should be 500 not 10, and the i should count from 0 to 1. The reason is that Im not gonna hook up 16 LEDsresistors to try a hello world script. I used a digital multimeter to check the voltage, and it takes a long time for the digits to settle. Even if I hooked up 16 LEDsresistors, 16 x 10 is 160 ms and that goes by in a blur. Thats fine for testing how fast the board works, but not for a casual initial test.",,,,,,,,

Im also a bit concerned about the proximity of the wheels to the switches and sliders it seems to me there should be a little more dead space between these two groups. Im also concerned about the distance between the wheels. On keyboards I use, these wheels are typically 1 to 1.25 apart on the prototype it looks considerably wider. The proximity of the wheels to each other is a performance issue when close enough to each other, one hand easily covers both and thumbindex and third fingers easily manipulate both wheels. Like JS says its hard to evaluate from the pics, but it looks like the distance might be a little wide though inconvenient from a design perspective, it might make more sense to orient both potwheel assemblies in the same direction to minimize the distance between them.",,,,,,,,

While it would be great to have a 4th axis to allow for more printing options, we believe that the Delta design is not well suited for a spinning bed, especially if we are looking to incorporate a heated bed in the near future. What you see in the video through you link is essentially color blending, something that RichRap did several years ago with one of his printers. When it was done by RichRap it was a proof of concept type of design. There are some issues with it, especially jamming when using a bowden system to do the blending instead of a direct drive system. We are looking into many, many different things for after the kickstarter run has completed and we will have some exciting announcements when it does. While Deltas do not lend themselves to dual extrusion it is still something that is on our radar as something to test as a possible drop in upgrade in the future.

If you feel so entitled that you need to have free stuff rather than just supporting a great project then maybe kickstarter is not the place for you. I am really sick and tired of the entitlement that has grown on this platform. A platform that is supposed to be dedicated to supporting creative ideas and products. You shouldnt be backing a project just so you can get free swag from the stretch goals. You should be backing a project because you like the idea or concept of the project. You dont deserve anything, you arent entitled to anything. The rewards are an incentive to get people to back the project, but they are not required to have a stretch goal. In fact stretch goals are a recent development in KS. When the company that I work for ran our kick starter back in 2011, stretch goals were unheard of, they just didnt exist. I have already backed multiple projects that have rescinded their stretch goals because of people who felt they were entitled to free stuff.",,,,,,,,

1551,326614000,188,"Martin Let me bring an engineers explanation. The simplest part of the hardware to modify is the turntable size and position.. If you use a smaller daimeter tuntable with its centre nearer the camera you will get macro without having to modify or move the camera. If you look at the drawings in the photo the turntabe is simply a froction drive on the edge ov the turntable, an alternative pully drive could be substituted to drive a closer centred turntable. Frankly if its not in the final version I could make that modification in half an hour in my workshop.

I have had so many people provide support in my business endeavors, I am happy to be able to pass on some of my financial success. I am particularly drawn to this particular project because I teach weaving to young people all the time. I learned to knit when I was 9 years old in 4H. I cant imagine how hollow my life would be if that person had not volunteers  given of themselves. So, for the past 40 years I have tried to pass on what I know, and I am really happy that I can financial support fiber art projects. And of course I cant wait to see the final product. Stay in touch!",,,,,,,,
1629,343646776,4,"Hi Virginia, The textile rewards have taken a bit longer to process due to unforeseen circumstances that had occurred during the last few months. The fact that I was using in kind facilities meant that I had to figure out access and wait for all or most of the files to come in. At the moment all the scarves and textile files have been printed. I steam set some of the fabrics today and will steam set the rest of them over the weekend. I just actually gained access to the steam setter last week and had to run a test to ensure it worked ok with the fabric coating. As I moved cities I need to find a local seamstress to hem the scarves. I am hoping that I will find that last key piece by the weekend and have the scarves out as soon as they are hemmed. The textile pieces should be shipping some tomorrow, some at the beginning of next week after they have been steamed. My sincerest apologies for the delay but as I relied on the kindness of others for access to certain technologies. Just a few more days I hope!!! Im as excited to get these to you a.s.a.p.!!! margarita",,,,,,,,

1640,346719935,9,"Great update, looks like it addresses the capacity concern. I guess next question is, canhow do we pledge for more than one unit  So, it is OK to connect NiMH batteries in parallel Did not know this before. I am not aware of any specific prohibition or disrecommendation on doing this, but it does not seem to be commonly done either. What would happen if one connects two or more cells together in parallel, with slightly unequal opencircuit voltages Would there be a circulating current causing the cells with higher voltages to charge the ones with lower voltages, until their opencircuit voltages equalized Any potential issues with parallel connection, e.g., rate of charge transfer magnitude of circulating current, or behavior if one or more cells is failing or defective. Any restrictions on mixing batteries in a parallelseries configuration For example, as long as the chemistries are the same and the endtoend voltage is within the 3.2 to 5 V range, will all of these configurations work where  means parallel and  means series AA  AA  AA AA  AA  AA  AA  AA  AA AA  AA  AA  AA AA  C  C  D etc. etc. etc. During charging of some arbitrary parallelseries configuration involving different sizes e.g., AA, C, D, will the subcurrents all flow correctly such that after however many hours it takes, all the batteries will be fully charged to their respective capacities Is there some tolerance and if so, how much for exceeding the 5 V limit For example, 4 NiMH batteries in series, if fully charged, might produce 5.6 to 5.8 V. Would there be any damage or misbehavior at this level In the update, section on Daisy chaining, it says ...you can wireup batteries mentioned above in parallel and get longer run time. So, in place of 3 AA batteries, you could connect 6 or 9 batteries, and get twicethrice as much runtime. Again, the hackers kit is meant just for that. As far as I can tell, the only difference between the hackers kit and the fully assembled kit is that the hackers kit requires assembly. If one intended to use parallelseries combinations of batteries, how would the hackers kit be any more suitable than the fullyassembled kit Is it because the hackers kit does not include a battery box, while the fully assembled kit includes a battery box designed for only 3 AA batteries, which would then go unused",,,,,,,,

Arduino pins are directly connected to SN74LVC4245As and according to its datasheet, page 5, section 7.4 All unused inputs of the device must be held at the associated VCC or GND to ensure proper device operation, so if I only want e.g. 10 digital inputs, do I need to connect other 14 to VCC or GND  Also how many samples per second will I get with 10 digital inputs 1 httpww1.microchip.comdownloadsenDeviceDoc22140b.pdf 2 httpwww.ti.comlitdssymlinksn74lvc4245a.pdf",,,,,,,,
1663,349608658,9,"Hi Rob Al, We did not think about offering the oscilloscope and voltmeter board with the UnoProLogic2. We will certainly have all the boards available for separate purchase once the Kickstarter and development period is over.",,,,,,,,
1664,349608658,1,"Hi Markus Laire, sorry for the late reply. To your question about protecting the inputs to the MCP6L04, the short answer is yes the inputs need protection, however, the user will have to provide this protection. The reason for this is that the UnoProLogic is not intended to be a final product. The user can add any analog signal they wish to the inputs provided they obey the 05VDC restriction. In analog electronics, it is very important to match the impedance of the output of the sensor to the input of the OpAmp. If we put a series resistor inline with the input to limit the current, we wouldnt know what value to choose. If the user wants to measure the value of an RTD temperature sensor then input impedance should be in the range of 10K Ohm. This would match the resistance of the RTD. If the user wanted to measure the voltage of a digital circuit, then the current limit resistor should be in the range of 1M Ohm. For the the 24 input logic analyzer, we will provide more details in an upcoming release. The basics are, the CPLD has a 66 MHz clock. It can save the state of all 24 inputs at the same time. A state machine running in the CPLD controls the save rate, so it has a maximum clock rate of 33 MHz. The EPT library has an observable transfer rate of 8Mbytessecond across the USB. So, we wont be able to transfer 24 inputs at 33MHz to the PC application. We will look into this issue more closely. The FTDI has a maximum transfer rate of 24Mbytessecond using the synchronous transfer rate. But, this would require a hardware redesign on the UnoProLogic2. We will map out the details after a few experiments and provide the results. As far as Texas Instruments data sheet on the 74LVC4245A, they typically write stuff like that. I think it means that unconnected inputs can act like RF antennas and can couple RF noise into the signals that are being used. This hasnt been a problem in past revisions of the UnoProLogic as all pins are connected to the Arduino. Even with the Arduino pins floating, there is a high impedance path to ground. However, I will write an email to the TI FAE and ask for more clarification on what is meant by this statement.",,,,,,,,

1678,350259914,152,"Hello Loop Labs, This is a very cool project, and I am hoping to be able to play around with a few of these devices when they are available. Unfortunately, I share many of the others concerns about your cloud policy. It sounds like you have a solid encryption strategy in place, but I still have a few concerns to ask about 1. Can you tell us whether you are building your own inhouse cloud infrastructure Your comments suggest that you might be, otherwise I would have assumed that you are using an existing cloud service, such as AWS or Azure. Could you tell us how would you plan to add your own guarantees on top of the underlying cloud vendor 2. In the event that Loop were to close its doors in the hopefully distant future, wouldnt it immediately render all existing notion sensors inoperable over night 3. In a happier future, Loop could be bought out by a larger organization. Even though it would keep my Notion system working, your detailed database of all user sensor data would immediately become the property of an organization which may, or may not, share your data controls policies. As an example, consider Nest. Can you provide information about which data you are actually storing in the cloud A complete log of sensor activity from my home, stretching over months or years seems like a fairly high privacy risk to me.

1724,365682114,19,"Saw you on Innovation Nation today Tuvia. Great promotion for your printer! Like others, updating more frequently would be appreciated, actually, expected. To continue to support and be excited about your product, regular updates will help us hang in there. Personally, Im ok without lengthy updates, but with other projects Ive supported here and on Indiegogo, the disappointment comes when when delays are announced the month that delivery was to occur or months after they were supposed to be delivered or worse, even after an updated date isnt met. Even with delays, level setting delivery expectations will help in the long run and hopefully prevent less refund requests. This is the most Ive seen in comments for refund requests as far as any project Ive backed. Same as Mo Rocca, backers do wish your team success! Like he ended the show with, Dream big and dont quit.",,,,,,,,
1725,367739181,6,"Hello, just a question to follow up on Clarences inquiry below. Anytime I try to charge any of my Apple devices, I get the charging is not supported for this accessory message. It is happening on an older iPod touch, two new iPhone 5s, a 3rd and 4th gen iPad. It does work on my much older HTC Hero phone, so Im wondering if there is some sort of firmware conflict that is preventing it from working with the apple devices, or am I doing something wrong. It is getting enough sunlight to charge the HTC sufficiently, and it initially registers like its going to charg the Apple devices, but then the error message pops up. Any help will be greatly appreciated as my main use for this will be in charging my iPads and iPhones. Thank you.",,,,,,,,

1838,389047198,11,"Heres a suggestion The Scarab takes readings periodically, not continuously, in order to preserve battery life. When we are at an interesting place or interesting time it would be great to be able to ask the Scarab to take readings right then. I assume the Scarab doesnt have any buttons on it, so this would require the smart phone app to send a request to the Scarab. Another possibility for the app is to give it the capability to set the frequency of readings. That way you could decide that at one time you wanted readings every 10 minutes while another time you only wanted readings every 4 hours to conserve battery.",,,,,,,,

It is very similar with a few keyboard layout differences. The Alt and Win key are reversed. The Arrow keys are smaller and all in one row.

Did all the activating asked for the bar code again and syncing again with the result that I lost all last weeks data and it keeps telling me to recharge my Goccia as it says it has only 1 power  despite the fact that all 12 lights go on when I place it back on the charger.

1970,413104742,29,"Glionite from New York City, NY reporting in! Order 8. First to receive the Glion on the East Coast. I was walking my puppy earlier this morning and the FedEx truck rolled by. My jaw dropped in excitement. First impressions 1 The packaging is well done. The scooter is suspended by styrofoam blocks very securely. 2 Upon inspection, everything is well built and quality control is excellent. Everything that should be lubricated is well lubricated. 3 The scooter measures roughly 36 inches when folded. I hope to buy a durable backpack in that length. Im looking at you Probity Cell. 4 The folding mechanism works like any kids scooter. To unfold, push the lever to unlock. Heres where it gets tricky. Due to the rubber padding they placed at the bottom of the hinge area to eliminate rattle, you have to give it a firm push to compress the rubber padding fully lock it in place when unfolding. To unlock, repeat that firm push again to compress the rubber padding again to release the locking mechanism. Im guessing over time the rubber padding will wear down and itll become easier. Ive had folding scooter locking mechanisms fail on me in the past so it is imperative to not use any brute force because these things are delicate. The handlebar height adjustment locking nubs are filed down to allow easier adjustment. Theyre not round. Kudos to that. Pull the handlebar grips all the way outward before folding otherwise theyll suffer premature wear. 5 The white paint is very glossy. Easy to wipe off dust and dirt in the future. The tires have silver paint overspray. They painted the wheels with the tires on. Im guessing to prevent scratches to the paint when mounting the tires Who knows. 6 I read the manual. The instruction manual states the battery will NOT be harmed when riding to complete depletion because the motor shuts off. I guess a lot of people ask them about that. 7 Time to ride. I know I should fully charge the battery before riding but I was too excited to wait. I only rode it maybe 50 feet as a precaution. The rubber wheels absorb some bumps. It is much smoother and quieter than those plastic wheels that I am used to. I weigh only 123 lbs so the 250W motor gave me a nice pleasant surprise when it accelerated. Lots of torque for a light person like me. It feels like accelerating in an electric car if youve ever experienced that. I instinctively reached my left foot to the back to push the brake but then I remembered the brake is on the left grip. There is plenty of stopping power for a light person like me. It felt like I hit a tree when I twisted the brake the first time. Use caution and apply the brake gently lol. The handlebar needs to be a bit wider for leverage. Due to how narrow it is and the short wheelbase, small inputs cause big movements. I would suggest the next version to have a wider handlebar. Good opportunity to incorporate space for headlight, phone mount, bell, etc. It functions fine as a regular manual kick scooter for short distances. There isnt much resistance from the motor to prevent kicking it yourself. If anything, the fat tires cause more resistance than the motor does. Just remember to keep the motor turned ON for braking. I would definitely recommend this scooter to people. Good job Probity Cell.",,,,,,,,

Most importantly, the kit included six 440 nuts matching the list on page 2, but SEVEN are required to assemble the unit. Not an issue here, but most folks dont have bins of 440 nuts within arms reach... The numbers listed on page 2 for lock washers and 19 mm screws are also low, but the package DID contain the correct quantities for those. The picture for Step 4 on page 5 is incorrect  it shows the front motor arm while describing the middle motor arm. Step 29 on page 18 seems to be missing a photo.

2014,419441561,1612,"I think on the go password management is certainly a useful void to fill but what about some of the issues with fingerprint readers. They are frequently regarded as insecure and easily bypassed httpwww.schneier.comcryptogram0205.html5 from 2002 even. My worry would be that the cheaper readers especially could be fairly vulnerable and good readers are much bigger and complex. The additional tap security may help but it seems fairly linear and easily observable I am not sure if the same wipe procedure exists for if it is screws up. I would recommend an option to allow the user to have to tap the device before it shows the password. This way if the voice recognition gets something wrong it isnt inadvertently showing a very sensitive password somewhere you didnt want it shown. I am guessing the software on the device will not be open source but it would be a good idea then if you could go more into how the security works. You mention 256 bit encryption, but how is it being protected For proper encryption the key needs to be derived from the fingerprint data that is read or decrypted by the fingerprint data itself but fingerprint readers generally work best against matching checks rather than hard data exporting. Keys would need to be sufficiently long which can be another area finger print readers fall down generating enough unique data for a specific finger that is reproducible. Other software vendors using finger print tech have severely fallen down in this area like httparstechnica.comsecurity201209windowspasswordsexposed . How does plugging into the computer work Do you swipe first on the device Are you entering some password on the computer Must software run on the computer If I plug into an untrusted device and retrieve a password could all my passwords be compromised If the device has an option to just act as keyboard its not an issue but from a usability standpoint that may not be a case. Not a deal killer but people just need to realize not to plug it in to an untrusted PC just use it stand alone. Password management software and hardware is a fantastic way to help better secure ones environment but if it contains security vulnerability it quickly becomes the hole in the dam that once you compromise you have access to all the users personal data and accounts.",,,,,,,,

We have not tested the BW05 off road with a vehicle yet, but it is something we will test prior to production. As you note, wind drag will affect the gimbal stability. Depending on the speed, you may need to install a wind fairing of some sort. The speed at which the gimbal will be affected by aerodynamic drag will vary depending on the cameralens combination you are using.

2047,428052329,147,"MarieAndree Poisson  I see I misunderstood. Thank you for clarifying. I think I will probably be lower my pledge down to one bulb, as well, and worry about additional bulbs once they have a higher, more useable wattage. The light in my room is already too low to work with and probably the best way to use this is in a light fixture with multiple bulbs in a main room so that if the lights go out at least one bulb still works, but also the room doesnt suffer from low lighting when the power is on. We have two such light fixtures in my house in connecting rooms, so I will have to consider my options. I might keep what I am at or I might just go with one since for emergencies, those rooms could probably manage on just the one bulb.",,,,,,,,

Try taking a bulb that is charged out of the fixture. Press your fingers to the end of the contacts. If the bulb lights, it is because YOU are completing the circuit.

Posting project fails just hurts the project if any newcomers come and look at it. Just because Kicktraq says they might not hit the goal doesnt mean it wont happen. With an extra surge of support at the end and more people sharing this project with others, it could draw in enough extra backers to make it happen.

2141,444286419,4,"Im not terribly surprised that it gets hot as you get up to 5v2A input. When I was looking a pololu.com and looking at the stepup and stepupstepdown converters, a lot of them had warnings that the unit might get too hot to touch the more power you put through it. For my uses, the 190mA250mA with a 500mA5v input will probably be sufficient for my needs. I view the USB912 as something to plug in for a unit used for awhile, and then it will be moved to the next thing that needs power. If you need higher power, it might be better to go with a battery designed for the load you are going to use. Now, Im a software guy and not a hardware guy, but I would think encasing the product in heat shrink wrap might make heat problems worse, in that the heat would be trapped in the heat shrink with no where to radiate to the outside. In addition, I would imagine if things get really hot, it would cause the heat shrink to bubble and become sticky. I realize the heat shrink is probably used to prevent random contacts with the circuit parts. Probably the best approach is to say is to do the measurements, and just tell people what the safe amount of power to draw is.",,,,,,,,

2149,446106147,1,"Great work everyone! It is so cool to hear about the kits in the wild. Jerry I.  Galatea About the twitching and overheating, The most important thing you need to do with any of the servos is to limit their travel in the control software. The swing of the servo arm is more than needed to actuate the finger. Make sure you set your software limits just short of the binding point of the mechanism. If the servo is buzzing back it off a little until it stops. This should be done for open and close. With my limits set correctly I was able to run my Roy animation almost nonstop for 2 days last year at maker fair and never had a servo fail. If you have a servo that wont stop buzzing no matter what position it is in, it may be bad. Let me know and I will get you a replacement. Hope this helps. As far as servo upgrades go, I am not sure what will work as a replacement. It is on my list of things to do. I know people will want to go to a more powerful metal gear servo, I just have not had the time to figure out what will work. Maybe one of the Hitecs. Happy Building, Brian",,,,,,,,

2175,453947499,26,"Gordons post on January 25th is very pertinent. When people backers place their trust in a project, they are naturally concerned about their investment. The creators of the project have an obligation to not only do their absolute best to see a project through, but also to reassure those investors. It is a very simple task to provide regular updates. Kickstarter provides the tools  all you need to do is click and type! Marco, you may think you are working hard on the project and that there isnt much news.. If that is the case, then TELL US! If you are having problems, TELL US! If all is running smoothly, then TELL US!!! I have backed other Kickstarter projects, some of whom provide a short email update every week. The abysmal amount of updates from this team, combined with late delivery, is worrying me and I am sure, worrying a few others. As the number of comments expressing concerns and perhaps anger appear to be increasing, without any response from the creators, the level of fear pertaining to this project and this method of funding is also increasing. It would appear that the creators cannot even be bothered to read the comments Controllino team, it is past time to start responding and produce some updates",,,,,,,,

Personally, Id like to see an actual plan with weekly, or biweekly updates, for when we will see something for our payments. Ive tried to be very understanding for these many months, but honestly this is already the project investment that I have the most concern about ever actually sending anything. Mostly because weve never heard a plan, just excuses about your work schedules, and Amys name disappearing off the project pages here all together. Personally, Id be happy even if it was sent completely unassembled. I dont care about color staining, or extra little widgets other than the ones I paid for. I also dont care about further support, since I invested in this because I knew I could handle any postpurchase messy details.

No need to waste money on an expensive 100 board I am printing a bracket to mount to ramps right now. When it comes to power supply you can either use a separate 12v supply or jumper the same 12v supply. The other cool thing you could do is run the extruder motors on 24v on the CNC board and run the XYZ on 12v. Or vise versa. I might actually end up using one of the extra stepper motor drivers as a tip wipe assemblywaste bin of some sort for the diamond so I do not loose build area.

2237,467724877,74,"If they fried then they were not doing their job right. Those higher voltages wont turn on until properly negotiated. Going outside that spec makes your device an unsanctioned USB device. USB3.x will certainly bring higher amps though. But if this meter flat out states its USB3.0 max then there you go. Even if you attempted to plugin a USB3.x device through this device it wont be able to negotiate those higher power profiles. Itll just not work which is to be expected and I dont see Bradly making any wild claims about this device being future proof FOR MANY YEARS unlike another project we all know about. Abdul Halim Mat Ali  Yes, cable length and gauge will greatly affect charge time. I use my meters the most for checking cable quality to make sure myself and my users are getting the most charge for their buck. Also no, a wall charger will not charge any faster. The fast charge function tells USB ports on things like a computer to kill any form of data transfer and to just allow straight power through the cable. Things like wall chargers are already putting out their maximum allowed power. Your Galaxy looks to use 2A max for charging so this will certainly help you charge faster on most USB DATA ports provided they allow up to 2A to being with.

But that wont work when youre going to make highspeed pictures flash fires only when the shutter opens and its necessary for highspeed imagery that the shutter opens first and stays open and the flash fires while the shutter is open  so better go with the adaptor or use a speedlite on the TTflash adaptor.",,,,,,,,

2261,471055882,118,"Hi Braxton, Weve just sent you a more detailed reply.",,,,,,,,
2262,471055882,94,"Mark and Braxley, thanks for sharing your thoughts and were sorry if you feel youve not had enough clarity. We had not expected to have so many questions focusing on our Pro Roaster which is not on Kickstarter. The reason weve mentioned it at all in our project is to establish that we have a strong track record of making excellent products that work as described  we are aware of other projects the over promise and dont deliver, so wanted to address that concern head on. To answer your points about the price difference directly. Yes the Pro and Home products are differentiated by the App as well as the machine and are sold at different price points. With the Home Roaster our aim is to make the user experience of roasting coffee at home accessible and rewarding for those who are new to home roasting, as well as enabling coffee roasting enthusiasts to take their interest in coffee to the next level. To this end weve design the home App to be as simple to use, while still allowing advanced features such as customizing and sharing the roast recipe. We are confident that users will be able to get great roasting results with 5 roast points and 10 minutes. If we are proven wrong we will increase the roast time and number of points on the home app  as stated in FAQs. As well as selling home coffee roasters, our aim is to set up a supply chain where we can source excellent coffee from producers and sell it more directly to consumers. As selling green coffee simplifies the supply chain we will reinvest 10 of the revenue from selling green coffee back into projects that help farmers produce better quality coffee and earn more money  which is a core value of our company more here httpwww.ikawacoffee.comaboutus. To grow the market for green coffee, we want as many people as possible to have Home Roasters so they can roast their own, which is why weve priced the Home Roaster as low as we possibly could and are aiming address the issues that limit home roasting to a niche market. The Pro Roaster that we already sell is aimed at the needs of professionals which are different to those of our target users for the Home Roaster and App. In this market we also aim to make best possible product for our users. As time progresses we will add features to the Pro App which will be added free of charge for professional users. If your interest is more oriented around the Professional Roaster, or you would like to know more about the features of the professional roaster which is available now, please email salesikawacoffee.com and well be happy to help.",,,,,,,,
2263,471055882,34,"Hi Jerry and Martin thanks for your comments about the stretch goal roaster colour options. For now we think its best to stick with these two colours white and red  this is because our overall priority it to ensure we delivery the roasters to backers within the timeframe and dont want to create additional complexity for relatively cosmetic reasons. By introducing more choice it adds to the complexity significantly  we already need to make the roaster work for 3 different mains voltages, so each time we add variable, the number of permetations multiplies 3fold! Also, our research before launching the project has suggested white and red are the two most popular colour options.",,,,,,,,

We all understand that when backing a KS there is an amount of risk assumed regarding what you will actually receive. In this case however with missing and broken pieces which may need to be sourced on my dime I feel there is actual negligence and not just a case of an immature product. Maybe the real question I am asking myself is if I want to accept this as a cost of getting the product. Of course this is all conjecture at this point as I have not received anything, nor is Mark answering any communications. I guess my real fear at this point is I will lose all my funds and receive nothing if I dont get in front of the issue and start raising this with the credit card company, etc. With that said, has anyone heard from Mark and has anyone received items that were purchased as addons after the campaign.",,,,,,,,

It feels really solid, fills the hand properly. But the problem I find, and as have many before me mentioned, is that there is a slight delay. The other problem I have is that if I dont press hard enough nothing registers, but if I press hard enough for it to register, I find that the tip would apply quite a bit of friction on the screen. It feels like Im dragging it across the screen to write. I would need a lot more pressure for it to work as apposed to the Adonit Jot. I think you should look into a different material for the tip. With better conductivity and less friction. Thanks.",,,,,,,,

They took forever to deliver my printer almost 1 year. They released their policy where they stated that warranty would be voided if we were to use any other resin than the one they make. Extended 1year warranty is 300 too much!. Once my printer delivered, the printer was smashed inside bcs they didnt care to put protection to this black brick hanging freely inside. Then the maintenance every month is a headache. Having to coat the vat after a few prints is not very practical. Lastly, for the record, reselling the printer would cost me 400 for ownership transfer, which is not mentioned anywhere in their websitepolicyforum. We are not buying a car! In summary, they chain costumers to their printersbusiness and I hate that. I see more freedomhope in your printer so just to make sure, I would like to read the details of that policy, such as the cost for the extended warranty and if there is an ownership transfer cost.

Projector lamp will typically generate approximately heat of 60 degrees and part of projector body can go as high as 83 degrees per tech report of DLP projectors  both are way higher than ambient temperature. We have a large fan installed on the outer shell to help cool down the projector besides the fan inside the projector. The good thing about our modularized design is that you can also open one side of the panel to expose the projector directly to air or use additional fans if you are facing overheat issue the projector has a thermal sensor and will stop working under risk of overheat.",,,,,,,,

2385,499497800,705,"Hi all  I just became a backer after attending the Cambridge event a couple of days ago. Ive been one of those people that whenever I use a pair of binoculars, stereo microscopes or even at 3D movies, I would always see double and it would give me a headache eventually and I know my IPD isnt out of the ordinary. With the Glyph, I easily made the adjustments so that I was seeing a single image  probably for the first time ever with these kinds of things. When I first put the Glyph on, I was surprised how comfortable they were. The headphones isolated outside noise very nicely and the ear pads were very nice  not cheap vinyl like they look in photos. After about 30 seconds, I felt comfortable enough that they wouldnt slip off my head and let go with my hands. No problems and they sat nicely on my nose. The smaller size and lighter weight promised in the beta version is all upside and Im 100 confident theyll be with me everywhere I go. With regards to the questions around if it felt like sitting in the middle of a movie theater or holding a tablet at arms length  its just a different experience. If I had to choose, to me I felt like I was sitting in the middleback of an empty theater. I think this was because of several reasons  The experience was so relaxing for my eyes that I felt as if I was looking at something far in the distance albeit clearly  The clarity and sharpness of the image was outstanding with truly no discernible pixels  Isolation from most of your surroundings but the image didnt take up all that space. So there was a black space below and around the image that kind of felt like rows of empty seats in front of me. I watched Life of Pi in 3D for a few minutes and was absolutely blown away at how natural the 3D felt with the Glyph. The total lack of eye strain and elimination of cheesy floating in air effects that you get in movie theater 3D puts the focus back on the movie and you quickly forget that youre watching in 3D. Ive never been a fan of 3D movies, but Im actually looking forward to them when I get my beta. Regarding the FOV  I think it could have been a bit wider, but just a little bit. I do think there is such a thing as too wide when watching movies or doing work I definitely dont want to have to actively move my eyes to the far left and right when looking at something at the edges of the screen. Overall, well done Avegant! In my opinion, the performance of the alpha prototypes are already worth the pledge and the beta should be even that much better.",,,,,,,,

2477,521363034,11,"Dear Cameron, Thanks for your valuable input. We are always keen on improvements to our board. Let me step by step answer your questions The reason why we have abandoned the SD card is twofold. First reason was because the FAT library eats up som much valuable programming space because you need to load a whole filesystem. Second, but probably even more important is that the SD cards have proven to us to be unreliable. We have had dataloggers in the field that stopped working after a year or so because the SD card could no longer be read or written. By including the Flash chip on the board it can be a very cost effective way of storing your data it works out much cheaper than a SD card and we believe 2MB is plenty for an Internet of Things device. Our data records are generally less than 40 bytes. so if you store one of these records every 5 minutes, you can store about 6 months of data. As SPI is a bus, quite similar to I2C, we dont really loose many pins. In fact we have included a header on the board where people could add an SD card. In fact we are developing a small PCB daughterboard with SD card holder that could slot right on it. Using the same SPI bus data could then be written to both SD card and flash. We have chose for SPI Flash instead of I2C Flash because of speed. We want to be able to read the whole flash memory in the setup routine to check where the last record was written, reading the whole flash over I2C would simply take too long. We have used Xbee extensively with the SODAQ, but always used SODAQ as the end node and transferring data with a Router or Coordinator which are always on. It shouldnt be too hard though developing a method whereby two devices are in sync. The onboard RTC is accurate enough. In our experience Xbee modules need less than 1 ms to startup, so indeed it makes lots of sense to let them sleep and only wake them for short transmission bursts. We have measured a power consumption of 52 uA when the SODAQ is asleep so that is well within the range your require! Again thank you for your input and we hope in future we can work closely together.",,,,,,,,

2482,522585048,45,"Thought Id share the responses from Steven to my questions posted below. Steven Pack says Hi Alex, Thanks for backing us! I will try and answer your questions by number. 1. Yes, if you set a daily limit for a profile it will be across all devices in that profile. So 30 minutes on the ipad and 1.5 hours on the laptop will use the 2 hours 2. At the moment the solution is based on turning on and off internet access, so offline games are not counted to the daily limit. We have plans to add this feature in the future. 34. Only things on the KoalaSafe network are tracked and filtered. We have plans to extend KoalaSafe into 34G, but it is not ready yet. 5. We buy the best web categorisation products available, combine and refine them. Parents can choose to customise these in their homes by allowing or blocking sitesapp. We plan to add a moral leadership feature whereby groups and communities of parents can follow each others suggestions. 6. Yes, when setting up a profile the defaults will be based on the age you select for the profile. 7. We obliviously run KoalaSafes in our homes and work place for testing. It is fascinating to see where we each spend our time. We are worried that most parents dont want to be tracked, but we can definitely look into adding this as a feature after Kickstarter, 8. No, as long as the settings for these services are on the primary the existing home router. The KoalaSafe ignores any DNS settings its client devices. 9. Australia is a far away place, but that is also Aussie dollars. Its about 11.50 in US dollars. Hope this helps. Steve",,,,,,,,

2494,522885941,33,"Hi Loxontrop, Good question. I will likely be doing a short tutorial based on one of the cores Ive ported over to describe how this handled for those interested in getting a better grasp of some of the FPGA fundamentals, and a UCF file will indeed be released that gives a layout of how the AlienCortex AV ports and the synchronous RAM chip are mapped to the pins on the Spartan. With that said however, most of the user guide and documentation and my attention will initially be focused on documenting how everyone will get the most out of the cores in Core Pack... especially those that are programmable with the AVR8 i.e. the XtremeG and XtremeR cores . This is for two reasons 1. There are already several resources on the internet for learning about FPGA basics, and VHDL or Verilog programming, so I would only be duplicating those efforts. 2. Second, AlienCortex AV was first and foremost designed to be a platform to enable those with even the most basic programming skills to leverage the capability of a chip like the Spartan 3e. A lot of attention was put into making it easy for anyone to use, and is really what sets the AlienCortex platform apart from other FPGAbased development platforms. Taking that into consideration, most of my attention will primarily be focused in that area, including creating new libraries for the Mikro compilers and Arduino IDE, and documenting their use. So in a word, yes, I will be providing UCF files and some basic information about core development, but understand that most of my time and resources will initially be focused on creating the best user experience for those who are creating video games, synthesizers, and robots with the cores in Core Pack. Thanks, Bryan",,,,,,,,

I did notice that one side of the clear plastic housing pulls up from the base some. Is this to be expected It isnt loose per se, but it did move as I was removing the charger from the bag. The sticker over the charging port has too much stick. Maybe a different glue format for the future It ripped as I peeled and it left gunk behind. The bag is secondary, and a nice little add on to be sure, but it is a tight fit for the viewcharger. Not too bad, just very snug. Which led to me finding out that the clear plastic wasnt locked in place. Also the plastic string clamp is pretty worthless, mine popped off and it doesnt do much to hold things.

From a wall socket, the Uiee charger features a standard charging speed of 1amp. 22.5hours for a 800mah battery To be honest, portable chargerbattery should be able to do much better than this! 800mah is comparably small compared to any normal smartphone, and now a days, smartphones can be charged anywhere between 12hours. To put things into perspective, iphone 6 1810mah charges to full in 2hours httpwww.gsmarena.comchargetestreview1239p4.php and the iphone 6 plus almost double the battery of iphone 6 charges in 310hours. I use iPhone not because Im a fan, I use it because they have the worst charging solution at the moment, not providing any sort of quick charge solutions comparing to Oppos VOOC and Qualcomms Quick Charge 2.0. I believe to make this product work, you really need to make your charge much more advance than a simple 1amp from wall socket! you need to at least bring Qualcomms Quick Charge 2.0, or a solution than can support it. You should at least bring it up to 5V2amp or better, 9V1.67amp. Samsung ships their charger with an Adaptive Fast Charger, which puts out 5V2A to regular devices or 9V1.67A to supported devices. this would be even the best similar solution, in fact, I would expect from a Creator who is set to focus on portable chargerbattery to be able to focus more and provide a better product than most smartphone makers, as most of them dont really focus on the charging technology except Oppo  Samsung, that I know of... maybe Im out of line here, I dont mean to be offensive, but with so much chargers  portable battery solutions already on the market, I dont see what advantage you really bring except making a conventional charger with 800mah battery.

As a wedding photographer myself I want it to be really quiet too, so there is some soundproofing material to fill the motor cavities.

We are negotiating with a number of factories, but are guessing that a higher level reward would have lower total s, so wed be less likely to convince, say, Canon. But if you know anyone there, wed love to talk to them! Jonathan Meltzer, Giocomo, Weiliang  others whove asked for multiple filters  if you saw yesterdays update, im sorry to say there was some miscommunication about the filter rewards. We are not allowed by kickstarter to offer more than one reward, so if you would like more than 1 filter, youll have to wait until we open for orders on the online store, which should be shortly after the campaign ends. But consider that the 4x4 filter material is big enough for several cameras, even SLRs. Apologies, though! Robert Hedges  yes, we realized that there could be some confusion on this. Yes, you do have to remove the infrared filter from inside the camera. Over on the Public Lab infrared discussion list httppubliclab.orgwikimailinglists, were intrigued by the idea of long exposure with no filter removal, but itd take some careful testing to prove that out. Tony, can you link to the sources you found Mauro P.  were not sure about the OTG connection, but the webcam version is already chosen, because we have a good relationship with a particular webcam manufacturer which is happy to do the filter switch. Well look into whether it supports OTG, but my phone does not support it. How do you access the webcam from your phone Charity  Im not sure, but it sounds like you may be talking about thermal infrared  just to be clear, the Infragram only takes nearinfrared, which does not really relate to temperature.

They cant really move fast enough for Kickstarter because of all the meetings and approvals they need to get before they can spend money. And they dont usually have a credit card or an Amazon account, which is necessary to make a pledge. As far as a charity pledging, they can certainly do it if they can meet the requirements of Kickstarter.

This is not a forum for which OS is better. Its to get these tools into every believers hands both MACites and Windowites. Keep going... you are running the race. God Bless",,,,,,,,
2638,555152870,34,"John, Thanks for your comment. Its precisely because of the questions about consumer vs. enterprise market share, US vs. world, our customers vs. the population at large, etc. that this Kickstarter project is a good idea. As I said in the project description and in the video, weve set a very low goal because we want to give the project every opportunity to succeed. If we can raise even this modest amount of funding, well make the investment in time and money it will take to get it done. At the same time, if every statistic we can find is correct, there arent many of us Mac users out there. Personally, I know lots and lots of Windows users and very few Mac users. In fact, I dont think I can name one among my friends and acquaintances. Maybe one will chime in here. But then, Im just one person and my experience is just that  mine. Just as your experience is yours. Neither of us can draw unarguable conclusions from our own experience. Hence, again, this project. I dont believe one can conclude that our Windows sales are a small part of our total sales because everyone is using Macs. Youre forgetting the intense competition we face in the Windows market from very, very capable and mature products like Logos. This certainly impacts our sales. And youre ignoring the fact that we were founded as a mobile Bible software company, we market ourselves as a mobile Bible software company, and we are widely perceived as a mobile Bible software company. This perception undoubtedly affects our sales on the Windows platform. The real question is, if the Mac market is TWICE the size of the Windows market, would we be happy with our Mac sales and would they cover our development costs What if it was 70 of the Windows market 50 30 What were saying with this Kickstarter project is NOT that we need it to be huge, but rather that we only need it to be more than nonexistent. The numbers we cite in the project description would suggest the market is all but nonexistent. But were with you  we suspect the reality is different. And like you, we thought a survey of our customers would tell us what we need to know. And thats what this Kickstarter project is A glorified customer survey. Like you, I will be thrilled if our fears are unjustified. Im working toward the goal of starting Mac development in August. Im assuming the project will be successful. I hope youll help us meet our goal and prove that you and I are right about this platform. Craig",,,,,,,,
2639,555152870,28,"Thanks Ken! 20year sounds like a good challenge to others. There are quite a few of our customers who go back to 19981999, and if you count the ones we brought over from Parsons Technology when we left there to start Laridian, there are some who go back even farther! ",,,,,,,,

Right now, we dont have an engineer in place to build out that feature, so well be building the custom graphics manually for supporters who back at those levels. Omar Each month will have projects of varying levels of difficulty. For the first few months, kids will be focused on the easier apps. As the months go on, theyll be understanding more and more of the harder apps and hopefully revisiting some of the harder apps of their first months. But, youre definitely right it WILL be necessary to create some kind of a Level 2 box to which kids can graduate when theyre ready. This will probably omit easy apps and begin to introduce more raw Javascript. We dont really know much more than that right now, but rest assured that its one of the first things well be working on after we get rolling.

2654,557230947,1251,"Gavin My 2 cents.... Not everyone who has supported this project will have the time or inclination to visit the comments section on here. So those backers wont know about the postcampaign thank you comments posted by Mark  others from the RR Team. Same goes for any interview in print, online, whether there is video footage or not LeVar or anyone else from the RR Team may have done shortly after the campaign finished. OTOH, by default, backers get email notices of posts added to a campaigns Updates section. Further, I liken this to asking friends help when you are moving. You thank them when they volunteer to  or agree to after being asked  help you pack and move your stuff to your new place. If during moving day, you realize that there was an aspect of logistics you forgot to plan ahead for and one of your friends volunteered to take care of it, you thank them right then and there as well. Finally, after youve moved in to your new place, you express your thanks a final time to those who assisted you. Its the courteous thing to do. I believe what a lot of us are expecting is that final courtesy thank you from the RR Team for helping them with their fundraising portion of the endeavor. Most backers, I think, realize that an update containing details about reward redemption via BackerKit is probably a week or two away.",,,,,,,,

2680,563251715,116,"Hi Jon, As someone who grew up playing Laser Challenge with friends and family, this is a godsend for something like this to be offered to Kickstarter  I love that its a pistol grip and that you can slide it off and use it on NERF NStrike and BuzzBee weapons. Its one of the things I love about this product, that it is designed to be used with existing products that are compatible and widespread. The same thing goes with the Vortex series. I think its an excellent choice that youve decided to go with a very wide range of devicesOSs as it is very ambitious for a product of this type. Personally I would like to see some real world testing with the AR technology to get a feel of what the end product would be like once this is in the hands of consumers. But other than that, youve actually hit a raw nerve from my childhood, and its very invigorating with this product. throws money at screen, but nothing happens sadface But other than that, I look forward to the day that I get my hands on this ",,,,,,,,

Was actually trying to see if they had magnets. Might be good to put some reference markings on the box so the magnets align. The solo game is very sensitive to the alignment marker. Trying to shot the missiles above or to the side makes it out of frame. Even getting to the game menu is a problem. Dont know if the program has to use the side reference marks a little better to allow greater range of shooting angle. Now if I could just mount my iPad well all be set  I sure hope that zombie game is made because it sure would be cool. Also for mounting the phones one can push the bottom higher up than expected. Its a little stiff at its default settings Let us know what we can do to help. Alot of us wouldnt mind debugging any improvements or new features. Thanks",,,,,,,,

As our Kickstarter pitch is over you can no longer increase pledges, so we are currently working on a payment process where others can do this if they so want. Will will update you all once this has been implemented. Kind regards Team Bubble",,,,,,,,
2759,578607292,529,"Hi Chia, Thanks for your backing of our project. To answer your questions 1. Blue seems to be the popular choice. In the interests of democracy once the pitch is funded were able to start sending surveys to our backers. What well do is ask people for their favourite colour combos and make the most popular choices. Id hope we get enough funding to do them all! 2. Were aware that a lot of accessories are iOS only and we dont think thats fair. We were the first and only to offer a 360 video and stills accessory for the Android platform  the BubbleScope. Android devices and accessories are very important to us and well be supporting as many devices as possible. We already have an S3 case for the Scope with a unique patented connector for our accessory accessories o  I hope that answers your questions. Thanks, Pete F",,,,,,,,
2760,584998291,97,"Nicholas, if someone cancels their pledge then it opens up a spot where the pledge was originally.

2762,584998291,178,"Jonathan, if you want a dive light, then buy a dive light. Having ports on a light to charge the light or power other items makes compromises to the integrity of the flashlight. 40m water proof depth for lights like this is rare, and the developers dont need to consider it. 1m is good for every day use, unless you plan on swimming underwater, or dropping it in a lake. It should be fine in the shower, torrential rain etc.",,,,,,,,

2769,585385246,42,"Love the new look caps. Do we have any idea of the most popular designs If I may, I think for starters, you should have only a limited range beyond the trademark fingerprint. By targeting the most popular designs only you will improve turnover and retail confidence in the product whilst still maintaining consumer choice. I would think that a leave nothing sitting on the shelf concept would be better than having one or two designs hanging around on the shelf. Retailers have an odd attitude to stock not shifting. Many forget the one or two designs that jumped out the door and easily focus on the 1 or two designs that hang around and cost them margin. I say get the interest up with retailers first then drop an extra design or two into the mix as the reorders start coming in. How are you planning to distribute them to retailers Boxes of 2030 packets or so That could break down as 10x the signature fingerprint design and 5x 4 alternate designs and maybe an option to buy a box of just 20x one design. Which will also help you see the more popular ranges directly from your own sales. My votes for the initial designs are Fingerprint obviously, Smiley, Skull  Crossbones, Snowflake  ShamrockClover. although a friend whom I asked for an opinion voted for SmileySkullCrossbonesHeartFlower... and said what a great idea Maybe use your backers for a definitive list of the 4 most popular designs to add to the fingerprint range Apologies for the lecture nature, its just my opinion and no more than a suggestion.",,,,,,,,

It turns out the problem was the driving of the servos straight from the Arduino without separate power for the servos. Anytime the input from the joystick was received, there was a dip in power to the servos. In other words, the initial current was not high enough to get the servos moving so it appeared that something was broken. In fact, the board just wasnt supplying enough power. I am going to try a motorservo shield in conjunction with the Arduino to alleviate this problem. Ill let you know if it works. Has anyone else had this issue",,,,,,,,

What is very important to me is to know that I wont become annoyed by the wake up sounds. I had used alarm clocks that tried to replicate nature sounds but sounded rubbish and others that had a nice sound like chirping birds but repeated itself after only 10 seconds. I can tell you, on that last one, the birds became very annoying after a while... Since you are saying it can play back only preloadeds sounds, I have some additional questions 1. How many sounds will be preloaded 2. How long will a soundset play before it repeats itself 3. Will you provide actual audio files of those sounds before the campaign ends I understand these wont sound the same through my speaker like through Wake, but I would need to have at least some idea of the soundscape. 4.

I have a couple dozen ATtiny 13A also 8pin chips here on my workbench that I bought on a whim because they are dirt cheap... amazing what you can do with them, but equally amazing how hard it is to fit a program into just 1k of memory! About the most I could fit was an ADC routine to read a photoresistor and blink a pair of LEDs I am a business software consultant that frequently deals with stuff that weighs in at well over a few hundred megabytes, so the notion of a sub1k program fascinates me  I guess I am easily amused I think a Blinky Fish might actually be a worthy challenge for them. Of course, with a ATtiny you end up also needing to implement an ISP header so you can actually program the thing. Unless you plan to preprogram before socketing which is not nearly as cool. Arduinos are cool and all, but nothing says getting down to basics like a bare microcontroller and blinking LEDs ",,,,,,,,

As far as your nonFW related comments Does it really make sense that we would intentionally send you of all people a defective device Does it make sense that we would intentionally send ANYONE a defective device In a twisted way, the only thing that makes sense for any KS project to do deceptively is not send anything at all and keep all funds. Im not totally sure you understand what is going here and why it would make absolutely no sense for us to knowingly send out defective devices. FW is not a cool product like a lot of stuff you can get on KS, its not a 3D printer, I have one of those and I gave it away. Its not cooler that mixes drink, its not a watch that relays a message from your phone, I have a flip phone and so does Mike so that wouldnt matter to us.

Mike and I funded 13 of the development of FW, weve been to numerous pitch contests, weve written to government agencies for funding, we talked to numerous service providers, I regularly connect with experts on energy efficiency through LinkedIn, we are in the running for a 250k grant to develop a version for the masses, and we have several investors looking at our business plan. Its not easy to pitch a boring product regardless of the impact. Sending out defective devices that we have to support is the last thing we would do. Are we going to have issues Of course, we hand solder the LCDs and they seem very picky but we view them at least 3 separate times before we ship, beepers dont all sound the same but we make sure they are steady when the they ship, we solder on the battery holders, the rear connector, the humidity sensor and the heater. Ive publicly posted the issues we have with the humidity sensor. Ive posted plenty of times here on KS and IndieGoGo and there really is not one place I do most of the positing. However I will tend to migrate away from the crowd fund sites because my email is located on the support page and issues will get transferred onto the support page. BTW I received your messages at 1222am , 1223am, 121am, and 143am. You have my email but I wouldnt want you to post your issues anywhere else but here where everyone can see because I have all the confidence in the world in FW. Thanks for the support. John",,,,,,,,

Would it be possible to program the userdefined button to mimic holding down the left button on a mouse This would allow me to click the userdefined button, lift my finger and move it to the touchpad area to resizemove an object. Once finished I could then lift my finger again and press the userdefined button to unclick the left mouse button.

It looks like Samsung is leading the way! httpdeveloper.samsung.comdevelopprofessionalaudio However with this good news, were still a long way off  creating an android app requires a thorough rewrite of the app. Now that we can see this new SDK, we can begin to experiment with it. Sad, while the intended hardware is the same for Android and iOS backers, the app may be quite different between platforms. If you have an iOS device but were an android backer, send us an email over to supportmogees.co.uk and we can swap you over to the iOS version. Sam  were hoping to synchronise the arrival of everyones Mogees with Apples introduction of the new version of TestFlight... this would mean everyone could get the app straight away when their unit arrives. It should be any day now for them to release it and weve got the units packed and ready to go. Conor  Mogees",,,,,,,,

Can you please confirm that this was not included in the package and whether you also require the charging cable and spare parts bag by emailing us at contactpuzzlebox.info You were supposed to have received the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile Headset  which if that was not included was a simple error on our part when shipping out for the holidays and I apologize for the mistake.

As you have aptly described, any type of boss or etching would increase our marginal cost, and we want to keep that number as low as possible for our customers. Nevertheless, we will consider these features as we 1 increase production quantities and 2 hire more designers. As for the addon features, these would fall under the category of firmware upgrades that are so useful that we think everyone should have them. Accordingly, we would offer these upgrades for free to our customers as soon as they become available  just like a software update on your iPhone.",,,,,,,,

As you probably know, Amazon is rolling out its own system to accomplish online reordering with a button click, and Amazons API for webautomated ordering is pretty limited, so its unknown what their position is on 3rd party reordering systems such as ours. In the short term, we will provide IFTTT integration so that people can use Droplet presses to automate certain web actions such as updating an online shopping list or sending an email reminder to yourself, or recording it in our app directly. These are the safest and simplest ways to make these systems work. Not everyone wants to mess around with IFTTT integration, so we will try to make this as simple as possible for our users who want to use Droplet as a reordering system. Because the Droplet system uses our servers, if it can be automated from the web, we can do it. Hope that helps explain the initial product vision!",,,,,,,,

I can understand that you are reluctant to redesign and possibly even retool production for a consumer swappable battery but Im still waiting on the details of the trade in program in the FAQ. While I hope it would be less than the asking price of a droplet I have no detail or guarantees. If I find as many uses for these as I think I could I may have 10 of them in my house and the thought of 10x per year when I cannot solve for x is concerning. I am in for 3 now but without more information on what my yearly cost will be Im hesitant to invest more. Disclosing the cost of the Droplet replacement program sooner rather than later could send your backing through the roof!

Ill report back after it does one full cycle as I know some people have had problems with the light dimming. One thing that was a bit of a problem was the stickers on the pods themselves. When I was pulling off the sticker the first one came off easily, the second one actually popped the entire lid of the pod off and broke. The glue on the stickers was really tough on 2 of the pods.

Have you attached a multimeter to pin 27 the attorst or pin 18 the general purpose button, to check the voltages externally They should both read high when the switches are open, and ground when pressed. What values are you getting Note that the general purpose button pin 18 is pulled high internally  this is set by default, though its disabled in the bootloader or can be disabled if you write to it. If your unit is not working correctly, we will of course replace it, please contact us directly.",,,,,,,,
3099,663167301,90,"Hi Everyone, Great discussion, I wanted to respond to some of the comments. The Bluetooth is 3.0, rather than Bluetooth low energy BTLE. This was a deliberate design choice! The main reason is that Bluetooth 3.0 supports the serial port profile SPP  your computer mac, pc, etc. just sees it is a serial port, with nothing to install or special interfaces. This is the type of behavior people tend to expect from Arduino, BTW  its basically just a wireless version of the USBtoserial that Arduino has been using for years. The other reason is speed. BT 3.0 his a higher overall data throughput that BTLE, by a fair amount. Since the whole ethos behind what we were doing with the Atto was to bring more processing power to the platform, the BT 3.0 seemed a better match. Okay, the other question thats been going around is the question of flashing by USB. Admittedly, we werent thinking of this as something that people would want, but it indeed seems to be important to some, who just want a wired connection. So, were now working on a breakout that will let you select USB for power  flashing, which will make the board function a little more traditionally. The tricky part is making the USB play nice with the Bluetooth, and keeping things simple and straightforward for the user. So, well be working on this circuit solution and associated board, and keep everyone posted. Thanks again for all the support!  AttoDuino",,,,,,,,

The point though is that LUNA prototype 600 MHz is able to report 8K9K flowssecond Luca did some measurements in production environment. 1GHz LUNA will be able to produce 10K flowssecond.

Its resources are fully loaded with the current software 100 RAM and 95 ROM, not much more room for options. Given a larger processor and more IOs you can of course do anything. As far as the programming goes, there are three arrays of PWM settings, one for each LED and the program steps through the arrays, in sequence. Each array has a different length so that it takes a long time to have them sync up and repeat the pattern. I plan more tweeking of this and will look to more features if possible.",,,,,,,,

But I cant resist answering your questions. Future software development can take place both inside the Vo96, and on devices that can communicate with the Vo96 over Bluetooth. It would be really great if someone would create a simple Bluetooth node capable of passing a gradient parameter  or 256 such  wirelessly. It would be great to see a pedal transmit a gradient over Bluetooth. If such a pedal emerged I want to support it. If nobody else gets around to it maybe I will make one. It would be useful all over the place, not just with the Vo96. It would be a good product  hear that out there Externalizing some control on a pedal that way it would be great. The most immediate possibilities for external software that would work with the Vo96 are available on IOS devices and any computer that has Bluetooth. I have certainly been dreaming of an iPhone or iPad app that would allow you to perform detailed additive synthesis sound design in a rich graphic environment and download timespectrum playlists into the Vo96 that would be assignable to presets. When I looked down the path of exploring acoustic synthesis thats a big tall shiny thing in the distance I really want us to get to! Custom firmware written by third parties  and custom applications written on connected wireless devices by third parties  thats definitely on the list. Before that happens I have to expose an API of all the basic levers of the individual control systems, and then define an SDK, wrap it all into one of the open software licenses, and make that available. All this is a lot of work and will require quite a bit more funding. So far Ive done everything on this project  the hardware, circuit design and algorithm design. Ive been working with a great coder who has taken my algorithms in Mathcad and express them in code I think possibly better than I can imagine having done myself. I do write code, but the practice turns me into an absolute zombie with a one track mind. So I decided I would draw the line there, and Im glad I did because I am working with a really smart software engineer who has done a great job of attending to the firmware. His time, of course, does not come for free. To your question about bending the pitch Thats one thing the Vo96 cant do, and in a way thats a very good limitation. It pretty much cant create a wrong note. The pitch palette is confined to all the natural harmonics of vibration. Some of those, played in isolation, would of course be wrong notes, but youd have to deliberately design the timbre that way  which would be fine if thats what the artist wanted. Since we are performing synthesis within a physical mechanical medium  in this case a guitar string  it is only possible to do the things a guitar string is intrinsically, physically capable of doing. A tensioned string has very strong resonances acoustic synthesis works with those resonances. What is really amazing to me is how much you can do within the space allowed us by physical reality. It is much more than anyone thinks. Ive read one or two comments out there where people are skeptical about the range of sonic possibilities. Its frustrating to me because even though what the Vo96 does now is pretty amazing and already more than some skeptics thought it would be capable of, I know much more lies ahead through firmware development within the Vo96. There is much more sonic range and character within the physically limited space of a resonant tensioned string then we have yet heard and Im committed to bringing all of it out to our ears. Anharmonic effects are possible as is modification of the attack  I just have not yet gotten that far with the firmware! Anharmonic effects yes  clean pitchbending no. Think about why that would be so  its the path to some insights. I am working on some rendered pictures, but people are also asking for some simple clear video demos of what you can do  right now I think those are most important. The transducer will be much as shown, but with cleaner lines and with the plastic lower away from the strings. There are 3 small holes at the corners for setscrew height adjustment of the transducer. Thom  download the Vo96 manual from down on our Kickstarter page on the left. That incidentally shows some possible treatments for optional touchpad graphic overlays. Those are really just drawings or photographs and can be anything  even custom. Im thinking about making custom overlays available  not saying yet well do it!

The card checks in with the phone every so often so when it misses a check in point, your phone would lock and the phone would store its location which will have been relatively close to the card. It does have an effect on the battery but you shouldnt really notice the difference. You wont see any effect on your data though! As far as losing both at the same time, thats a great point! Weve tried to cover that issue through a few methods. In the app, youll be able to select a lockout interval if you choose so youre phone asks you for your PIN at an interval you select. This is just to add security and double check that the actual owner is still using the phone. The other method would be to jump on Android Device Manager or Find My iPhone and lockwipe your phone from there! Wed include that function in our app but they just do it so well right now.

3324,719724525,11,"Hi Chad, I noticed that CALB had a higher capacity that spec but still 7 is the same number and if that is true a 2  year in storage then in 10 years that will be 20 and this means that battery is already dead with just 10 years of storage. Maybe their observation where wrong or they keep the batteries stored at high temperature. As an example Sony for they LiFePO4 in storage give a 3 loss in 10 years storage at 23C and about 10 loss at 45C same 10 years. Not sure how effective the warranties on batteries are at least for long therm. If the battery is good in the first year there is no reason that will change with LiFePO4. Im really curios now to test my capacity loss in my 3 years old GBS that had about 1 year of storage and two years of daily use. If that is small as I suspect below 5 then I will start recommending GBS at least I have the experience with those. On paper GBS looks worse than both CALB and Winston that is why I did not recommend them.",,,,,,,,

3415,743825109,19,"A couple of minor suggestions. I too would like the option to move the OLED device off of the Pi, but if it cant be, it cant be. In terms of the RTC, is there any way you could add a coin cell battery to power the RTC when the Pi itself is turned off. One of the things I use the Pi for is in a camera setup with the Pi stuffed into a Polaroid model 95 camera, and Im often in an area without wifi access, and having the RTC is useful when I cant do ntpd to keep the time going. The other RTCs that I have Adafruit Chronodot, etc. have a coin battery, and I just have to setup the RTC once in an area I have networking, and then power off the Pi until Im ready to take it out. When powered back on without wifi, it resets the time from the RTC. Your unit would allow me to switch batteries or switch tofrom wall power and it would keep the RTC running, but if the backup battery fails, the RTC would lose time. It would be nice if you had i2c, serial, spi breakouts on the pcb if you had room. Have you mailed batteries to the USA without problem While I can source batteries locally, it is a convenience to have a large battery in the shipment. But if the battery would cause problems with delivery, I can easily remove it.",,,,,,,,

3432,746779028,321,"Trevot  The IO is all 3 volts only. The chip has a 3.3 volt regulator that can provide about 100 mA, so you can use the 3.3V pin to power your 3 volt circuits, if they require 100 mA or less. If you need more current for circuits, you need to connect an external regulator. Usually 5 volt signals can be connected with a resistor in series to limit the current it will drive the pin to about 3.9 volts. Most 5 volt devices can accept a 0 to 3.3 volt signal, but in cases where you really must drive some 5 volt widget with a true 0 to 5 volt signal, a level converter would be needed. Longterm, 5 volt signals are becoming mostly obsolete. Bruce  Solarbotics briefly carried Teensy years ago, around the time 2.0 was released.

I want to build peoples knowledge from the basics to give you tools to make the designs you want. The Papilio boards from what I can tell give you some large blocks and let you connect them up with minimal VHDL. They do let you write your own VHDL, but I dont see anywhere where they teach you how. Our goal it to teach you about digital design which will give you the tools to tackle any project you want to undertake. So, in summary, the boards themselves arent very different. Its all about how you go about using them. You could say the same thing for the Arduino boards and many other AVR development boards though.

3485,763624627,41,"The creators of the LIX 3D pen are surfacing after a long absence with bits of good news, sort of, kind of ... The most positive aspects  they seem to still be around and working out the bugs, not forgetting they need to deliver a working  useful device to the backers. Creators need to keep the communication flowing ... They also need to communicate to the greater public as the news, mostly bad, is spreading. Bad news always travel faster and wider than good news. As Peter Huizar expressed, LIX needs to build back the confidence from the backers as well as garner positive commentsreviews to keep their nose above the deep water they are currently in. Other 3D pens are taking over, one in particular getting skinner in its 2nd generation, more are to come ... It will take a lot more than the last update to achieve a recovery. Great to see a couple of new videos, ones showing more then just melting plastic pile up. I like the use of the plastic cup as a mold for the vase. Its something someone like me could do as opposed to the master pieces shown early in the campaign. Of course, I could of done that year ago with a fat 3D pen at 50, the first generation 3Doodler and, more recently, their 2nd gen ... LIX 3D pen, or its current prototype, seems to be working well enough to make things, YES ... there is hope after all. But the clouds are still looming over your heads. Still no schedule for delivery, one with attainable and reasonable dates. Then there is the question of thepower bank, as an added cost at that. Given history, are we misunderstanding the few words found in the latest Update or are we being led to more trouble Creators need to make it clear AND positive for the existing backers. I wishfully suspect they are saying it runs on USB but an external power bank is being designed for more reliable power not all USB ports, especially off laptops are made equal much less more than 500 mA or so .. As others have stated, LIX should probably swallow the pill and GIVE one of the external power bank to the 8000 or so backers those waiting for their 3D pen. There is the noise issue. Related to it, there seems to be an issue with speed andor heat ouput ... Of course, its hand operated, so I dont expect lightning fast extrusion, much less high precision especially with my shaky hands. I suspect setting the temp a few degrees warner is it possible  would get the flow going, when needed ... However, cooling will take more time as the plastic is warner. A delicate balance which experience will guide. I did mention noise. Is that being worked on before mass production  However, dont let that be an excuse not to deliver to the very early backers. In fact, you should ship them the first 20 with hope they give you constructive feedback so you can further tweak before mass production. The 20 should also get a free final version call it 1.0 for their patience and trouble. No, Im not one of them ... All backers should get some extra or longer plastic pieces with their LIX 3D pen, for their patience. Talking of plastic rods, they should be longer as they seem quite short compared to the pen. This seems to create a lot of waste, especially for the beginners. Could we use small spools  There is the power cable in the way anyways. A few feet of plastic should not be the end of the world ... How did you make the multi color vase  Watching the video, before seeing the photos, I thought of loading different color plastic short does make sense then, eh  However, your photo show a greater variation of colors. Thats not an other of your photoshop rendition, is it  DO NOT show anything the ordinary user cant easily reproduce or, especially, you cant show in a movie. I am getting a glimmer of hope ... Creators, see, it would not of taken much over the last year or so to keep the backers at the edge of their seat... excited and eager to get their LIX 3D pen, rather than making their own movie imagination and human nature about what a scam you might still be ... By the way, the hairy leg guy in the latest video had shorts and a Tshirt on, right   Looks like he wasfelt at home, just like most LIX 3D pen users hope to be ... sooner than later.",,,,,,,,
3486,763624627,9,Im shaking my head here...the first thing that should have been done was line up the manufacturer and shipping company. After all when you introduced this project you stated you were ready to go. So that was a lie too. Truly infuriating! I glad I backed the 3 doodler 2.0!,,,,,,,,
3487,763624627,6,"To make public my comment in the last update as it is becoming quite clear the LIX is a scam from the get go proposing project to KickStarter  Just as Judi comment in last update says, how on earth could you establish your pricing when you dont even have a manufacturer picked 6 months after the initial delivery date passed ! Not forgetting there may still be issues with the prototype as manufacturing processes have yet to be encountered ... Shipping could and should of been worked on in parallel from the beginning, not some 6 months after the initial shipping was to take place !! Wait, what about packaging  What shape and colour will the boxes be  OMG, this could be a show stopper pushing delivery even further. Sorry, someone has to laugh about this campaign, aside from those few who are enjoying 1,200,000  of our hard earned money. It is good to see more frequent news. It is bad to see that they are simply making the situation a whole lot worse for everyone, KickStarter, LIX and the backers. The more we hear, the worse it gets. Are we beginning to regret asking for more updates yet  i preferred my imagined version even when capable of thinking of the worse ... seems LIX as me licked in that department. At the very least, KickStarter should get a red flag when a proposed campaign doesnt have any clue. Maybe LIX BSed their way through KickStarter review process just as they are doing with the backers since the campaign was successfully funded ... KickStarter  when a proposed campaign as some fancy videos and the likes, it is time to look a bit deeper at the team members and the project. If we think Kickstarter screens projects, that just refers to the quick check we do to make sure each project meets our rules before it launches More important, to both KickStarter quick check and LIX approach from the beginning  Projects must be honest and clearly presented. Our community is built on trust and communication. Projects cant mislead people or misrepresent facts, and creators should be candid about what they plan to accomplish. When a project involves manufacturing and distributing something complex, like a gadget, we require projects to show a prototype of what theyre making, and we prohibit photorealistic renderings. LIX, here are a few hints from the creators handbook offered by KickStarter  Consider the costs Remember that youll be producing and delivering the rewards that you offer. Presumably youll use some of the money raised on Kickstarter to make that happen. Plan ahead and budget accordingly for these costs. Make a list Write down every possible expense, even less obvious ones like the cost of packaging and shipping rewards. For larger expenses, research your options and see who can give you the best deal based on the quantities you expect youll need. Total it up. The number might be bigger than you expected, but thats okay. Think of this rough budget as your ideal budget. If it feels too high, consider different aspects of your project you might be willing to compromise on to cut costs. In regards to updates  Even if things arent going according to plan, you should definitely keep your backers in the loop! Fulfillment means getting your rewards to backers and communicating with them as you complete this process. Like every other step, this one requires planning and budgeting. Shipping For any physical reward that you offer, youre responsible for delivering it to your backers. Unless you plan on handdelivering rewards, this means shipping. Plan ahead for how youll send each reward, how youll package them, and how much theyll cost to ship. Dont forget hidden costs like bubble mailers and packing tape and hand cramps from filling out custom forms!. Adding shipping insurance might cost a little bit more, but might also give you peace of mind. The best way to get started is with some research online. Start with the basics like mailing guides, checklists, and bulk mail information from your postal service. Dont want to handle shipping on your own There are lots of great fulfillment services out there that can handle shipping for a cost. If you decide to work with a fulfillment partner, do your homework and figure out which one can best handle your projects needs. So, how many of LIX team is vacationing in China for a few weeks at our expense  Looks like three from the first picture. Remind me how many members are in the LIX team again, please  I hope all potential creators and backers of all crowdfunding system look at this project and learn what NOT to do. It would at least make my part of the 1.2M worth the trouble. If I ever get a 3D pen, or anything close to it, from LIX, that will be the most unexpected bonus at this point of this sad saga.",,,,,,,,

We will keep developing new features, and keep making sure that our app is on par with the latest guidelines, and tap into all of the newest features available on both iOS and Android As for our previous comments about the other sensors, then yes, we will of course investigate the opportunities, as we have previously written  one of those opportunities being to tap into the on board sensors in the phone, another one being a device with more sensors.

I really would have though they would have waited and sent out an absolute best we can do unit, rather than a better than before.

I dont really care personally but I think maybe some others do care about this engraving thing. Then for the next 400 000 goal, I really think the original colour design scheme red wheel  black trucks colour combo is already the best, I understand this gives more options for others to choose from, but at the end, all Inboard wants is to boost the pledge, but this colour changing option is really not a wow factor to attract more backers. I rather have the 45mins Rapid Charger as 400 000 goal. And for 500 000 goal, may try to go for 4 wheels Manta Drive rather than just rear wheel. I know I might be suggesting something which you guys think its insane and not considerate in terms of the cost and it would drain out battery much quicker. This is just my thoughts about the current stretch goal, the products itself is a wow, you guys did a great job on the design, but the stretch goals are just not so wow.

Just stops extruding. Not sure what this is.. Also, it seems that the Z axis gets out of sync and I have to try and reset it by moving one of the motors up or down to relevel it..

3548,777090264,1,"Michael, guess you came to the same conclusion as we did. Were going to start by replacing the original hardwaresoftware first and see where we will go from there. With luck hopefully we wont need to change too much of the actual cnc hardware, but well see. Its a shame. Without the access to the open source side of things, we cant fix the bugs that the firmware is riddled with and sadly, support from Amaker is virtually non existent. But I guess at least we were lucky enough to have the major broken parts replaced. But I doubt that many others will be so lucky. Its a shame, but as Ive said before, this printer is just a prototype.Its nowhere near ready for release. And honestly, its a shame. It could have been something great! But its not. I am excited about the new hardware Ill be putting into it though!",,,,,,,,

To the right of the check box, there is a button you can press to do more tweaking. I think you want to play with those settings to get the head to retract a little bit. Try the zHop setting to see if that works. I guess aMaker is out of business, they havent responded to one of my emails or comments here. I will have to build my own filament bracket.

3573,782259474,56,"Lots of questions and I will try to answer them. 1 Most of my research came from this very useful document httpwww.atcsd.compdfHSSWHTPAPERRevE.pdf Switch I believe the enclosed letter explained it but here it is Left  transducers off, Middle  normal, right  test tone This switch is programmable f you buy the Sigma Studio programming dongle for 200! Mono Input Input is stereo with the LR signals mixed inside the DSP. See the schematic for details on the actual wires. Output is mono audio into a 39.5KHz square wave oscillator. This frequency is shifted about 100 degrees in both directions at up to 2kHz. The more you shift the PWM, the louder the audio you hear. Bandwidth is very limited so the DSP has filters, compressors and limiters to help keep you from over driving them. The audio you hear is from air molecules vibrating at 39.5kHz and then colliding with each other or objects. I have tried two channel drivers and they seemed to offer very little improvement. My guess is that having 39 transducers firing at the same time still get out of phase and that is also what lets you hear the sound. This that have two Soundlazers may offer some further experimenting in this area. Stand 3D printers are useful for this. httpwww.thingiverse.com would be a great place for someone to post their design for a case. I believe my STEP files can be found here httpwww.soundlazer.comwpcontentuploadsSoundlazerCase.zip If you have a 3D printer, you know have a case. The future of Soundlazer This was exactly what Kickstarter intended it for A project. I have no plans on taking this project any further once all the units have shipped. I have a few extra units and once they sell off, that will be it. It is up to everyone in the community to take it from here. Yes, low power mode is better. My ears hurt at times too!",,,,,,,,
3574,782259474,161,There seems to be a great deal of interest in pointing Soundlazers directly at your ears for long periods of time. WARNING The Soundlazer produces 120.5Db  40kHz which you cant hear. You must point it at a wall or some other object and bounce the signal at short ranges to avoid hurting yourself! Sound quality in parametric speakers is low fidelity but the internal DSP does a good job of making it sound good.

3615,795555056,0,"Got my disc, love it. Good work guys. Heres the email I sent to the Tobu guys how do you like the plastic Love the plastic. Great grip, looks good. I live in Oregon where everything is always wet, even if it hasnt rained in a week, the plastic grips very well even when wet. I havent hit anything with the disc yet so I dont know about durability, but it feels like it should be very durable.  what flight ratings would you give the disc 9 5 1 2 Its hard, the dimensions lead me to think its more of a speed 78, but it flies more like a speed 910. Very nice flight, good work making a unique mold in a very overcrowded market. Ill throw it some more after work today. Nice little s curve easily out past 300 feet ending dead middle.  is the textured rim feature useful I love the textured rim. I always grip on the roughest spot.    is the app user friendly Love the app, Ive got a few nit picking details Ill right up and send. Overall its great, it looks great and is snappy. Very intuitive compared to the other disc golf apps Ive used. Good work.  is there anything youd like to add to the app or the disc The cap is rather difficult to remove sometimes. Ive noticed that the tracker has a square component that sticks up a little and there is a recess that is should go in. If I miss the recess then the tracker pushes on the cap making the threads bind. If the tracker needs to be aligned to the disc, have a little notch so that it can only be put in one way. But even without that, its still a little difficult to unscrew. Maybe a little slot to put a coin in would help andor make the cap textured like the rim to add better grip. The beeper could be louder. If theres traffic nearby or a bit of wind I imagine its going to be hard to hear.",,,,,,,,

3622,798069470,847,"ramboky  Given the hate people have for Craig around the Open Pandora project, I unfortunately doubt hell learn any lesson from this. The iCP2 project is being handled like all his past projects were. He hasnt learned a thing from those. I had personally hoped he had grown up, having brought this project to Kickstarter. Unfortunately, I was wrong in that assumption. Regarding whether or not fraud has been committed, it really depends how Kickstarter contributions are seen in court. Lets say I started a company and went to obtain VC funding, but I falsified information to convince VCs to give me money. This would be considered fraud, at least in Canada. Im fairly certain it would in the USA and UK as well. Craig made a big deal about delivering on time, yet youll find in the updates that there was never even a remote chance he could ship during the stated timeframe. Is this fraud Its complicated, as the end result is only that backers will get their units late. From what Ive been told, the most anyone could hope for in any legal proceedings is a return of their investment in the project. Thats something which can likely be done fairly easily outside the legal system, so its not really worth the effort. I really dont care about the money, so Im just going to sit back and wait for my controllers whenever they happen to ship. I just hope Craig will one day be held accountable for the way hes treated people whove supported his projects. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.",,,,,,,,

3846,839660022,227,Nicholas ArmstrongCrews If i understand what your asking i do not think you will be able to finish just portions of a print. This product creates a sealed chamber that heats up acetone until it turns into a vapor which will completely envelop your print. That being said it might be possible to put some take on areas you didnt want finished and maybe the tape would protect it or maybe the tape would just fuse to the print or maybe the acetone would dissolve the tape. Who Knows. Maybe when they answer your question they will have some suggestions but thats my two cents. Have a nice day.,,,,,,,,

Have you posted an MSDS regarding acetone Or other reagents used in Magic Box on your website or in your literature Was there a problem with the reagent reacting with the plastic housing That actually made sense to me. What are you doing to avoid the reagent reacting to any coatings you might use on the aluminum, since acetone does not primarily react with untreated aluminum or similar alloys Now, I am seriously worried about the acetone reacting with exposed wiring or other components in Magic Box if this is no good seal around the chamber...and how to vent it to the air outside of our little workshop...

3855,842797490,740,"Marc  I understand where you are coming from, however this is not the first time that weve been told that we would receive the product. If you tell youre consumers that they will be getting their product, they started to get excited and want to play with their new item. When you fail to deliver it and then say another time that they will get it this week, it just gives people a sour taste in their mouth. Simple point is, if you tell people that you are going to deliver, then deliver! It wouldnt be so bad if they were in here talking to us to let us know what is going on. However that isnt the case and for those of you that dont know, you can see when the last time they logged on was. Just click their name on the right side of the page.They logged in yesterday and their last communication with us was three days ago. Thats not cool. There are comments, doubts and angry consumers that want to be heard. They should jump in and do damage control before people have way to sour of an opinion about them as a whole and decide to never support them again. Either way they should come in here, let us know whats going on, and try to make us feel like we did months ago when we first backed this product.",,,,,,,,
3856,842797490,380,"Ok let me get a few things out in the open, I was one of the first to request a refund, first or of frustration and lack of understanding how things work on kickstarter, I was frustrated with delays and no reward on hand. Since then Ive become more patient and understanding that problems do happens for firstimers and delays will happen, but what has really plagued this campaign has been misinformation or lies. What do I mean by that is that fringe get go to seems that we the investors were duped. We were told that Dark energy had a team member in China with strong relations with the manufacturer, which it turns out was a complete lie. Then that the design was changed by the manufacturer was changed after several units were produced and that they  Dark energy was unable to change it back. Then the units were shipped on one week then on another week and then finally all units were shipped by 22 of September. Then after weeks of complaining and threats by backers finally acknowledged some issues with the shipper. All this is just until early October, until now there is no official acknowledge of issues with the Chinese postal service and their new rules, all of this information comes from third parties. I dont really want a refund, to my believe that money is lost, I just really want an apology from Dark Energy and better communication from them. As an investor I believe I am entitled to exact numbers of current backers with units, also the sales numbers from the website presages and also the exact numbers for the warehouse inventory at the moment. Also why does it take so long for you as a company to acknowledge the fact that you cant refund any backer pledge. Please explain that, your complete lack of transparency is the main reason for the refund request. Again I hope that this will help some of the backers understand the situation but the best thing to help calm us would be acknowledgement from you that there were mistakes made and which mistakes were made.",,,,,,,,

Still working on refine my 3D printed turbine, not that it will ever fold or produce much in the way of energy. Since its been a while I was wondering what sort of progress has been made over the past month. Im interested to see what design they come up with for a foldable wind turbine that isnt too heavy and compact. My turbine is 45cm diameter and 60100cm high, my estimates come up at around 1020 Watts on the low end of the scale to about 50 for the higher version. Getting a proper sized generator is proving to be the most difficult thing by far.",,,,,,,,

4094,884613928,18,"Merhrdad, great to hear from you so glad your project was a success, by the way!. Because were starting out with a full audio substitution, we need to utilize a larger wearable e.g. vest the throughput for the information were trying to convey is too high to fit onto a small number of interfaces. For other applications, we could and plan to move to wristband formfactors. There is also the question though, of how conspicuous such devices should be! As far as vision goes, its a great idea. We mostly our former colleague Don Vaughn have done a bit of work in the lab playing with ultrasound sensors not attached to the VEST, though, but havent taken it very far yet. Hopefully this is something we can work on more in the near future!",,,,,,,,

To them it was a item that cost 50 bucks and then they look at the shipping and add that to further calculate. If youd listed it as costing 0.

We would like to tune the acoustics of the speakers more, and develop a full hardware machine interface MMI. 3. ... We havent finalized our electronic board adjustment... 4. ... However, we feel that our current charging port is too big and taking up space that can be used by a bigger battery. We are exploring other options such as pin charging and USB TypeC. We are building prototypes with different component configuration to learn more about durability, charging speed, and overall size. These cause delays, which is quite understandable.

4105,886946870,22,"Gerrit I do understand and im in essentially the same boat as you are. Its annoying, and it has taken quite a while. I do know however that physical design iterations can be very time consuming, not only in design and tweaking but just in pure manufacturing time. I think likely given a more structured start, SAL likely could have maintained a tighter control on their timelines. Hiring more specialized staff and more focus would easily have shaved months off the timeline. Given the structure of Kickstarter however, they are allowed to make the best product they can using the best means they think rather than one that meets some other peoples needs. Is it the best or just different Im not sure, but it is all part of the experience. Ive enjoyed the more active comment responses, but a simple update ever two weeks i agree isnt that outrageous. Still, to each their own  and we all should know how easy it is to keep your head down and working for countless hours forgetting everything else.",,,,,,,,
4106,886946870,43,"Aaron and all Thats fairly accurate. Testing has shown that, while awesome, its not quite ready for tooling  1.0 production. And also, the firmware is not done, either, like you said. Someone commented a while back during the Kickstarter that this should have had a September 2016 production target. I had hoped to get to regular production by now, but its just not quite there yet, and doing final engineering for tooling and the tooling itself moldmaking for plastic parts is very expensive hundreds of thousands of dollars, and not something you want to do if youre not very sure its ready. I have a very high level of confidence that we will be in regular production before September of next year. On the other hand I think were a few months away from production at the earliest. So lets say were 416 months from regular production, and that minus 1 for a preproduction run on the tools for the pioneer backers. Meanwhile, 3D printing prices have dropped an order of magnitude, and where it was costing us 2500 to 3D print a set of plastic parts for a full pair Kings Assembly, now its down to 250 and will be  needs to be 1025 for mass production with injection molds. The good news is that we just finished testing the leftmouseasjoystick firmware therefore as it is right now its a full keyboard, mouse, and 3 joysticks when plugged in!, and the plastic is at a good enough point to call it a working beta! The parts are engineered to be printed on a 3D printer, not tooled, and like I said there is still some development  testing needed, but we could actually run a beta program. The units would be expensive, but perhaps if people were willing to up their pledge to cover the difference, or if there were some early adopters at large that would be willing to pay 500600 to get betas right away, we could probably make it happen.",,,,,,,,

Its quality is far above what I usually get from kickstarter projects and even much higher than what I would expect from more seasoned companies. Now its about 70F degrees here right now so not completely fair to test but it from the little playing I have done it is fantastic. Now I just need a second one and the aircomforter. The wife finally understands what it does and how it works and is so ready to try it out tonight when it gets down into the 50s and in the low 60s in the house to see how it works for her.

They posted warnings numerous times about not directly charging items, which would have served as covering them legally. To deliver anything other than what was promised at the time of closing the funding period constitutes fraud. The fact that they are still silent on the matter lends toward the possibility that they may never have intended to deliver the product advertised, which would if true also constitute fraud. Tellurexs actions in this matter tarnishes KickStarters reputation and may impact 1300 individuals to back other projects.

Its been engineered with an amount of care that you dont usually see in this industry. The doortrigger buttons you usually see are ugly, the kind of thing you want to hide from the public. The Max Actuator is something that is genuinely nice to look. If I owned a building, it is the sort of industrial design I would want to have frontandcenter on my property.

4191,898927365,16,"ZarK, we completely understand, and I think perhaps weve done a poor job explaining our motivations for giving news the way weve done it so far. Let me try to elaborate. For many kickstarter users, getting alerted to little updates on a weekly basis is too much. After a time this could start to feel like spam to some. What weve tried to do is give those who prefer lots of little updates several avenues for getting them i.e. fb, twitter, and our website blog while reserving kickstarterbased emails and official updates for bigger project news. We were planning to use this platform to announce milestones or major events. By the way we should have something of this nature to announce within the next few days. Using this type of structure seemed like the best way to let our backers choose the frequency with which they received news. That said, I agree it has been too long since we put out an update on here. Additionally, well start creating content that only our Kickstarter backers can see. Obviously we wouldnt be doing any of this without you guys!",,,,,,,,

That does not mean that the APIs are not similar enough that a thin translation layer would solve any cross platform issues! They guy starting the discussion is already using the Chrome API as a starting point, but the API will surely evolve over time.

Espruino actually has separate types for integers and floats internally to cut down on calculation, however both are 64 bit.

If I use it for snowboarding, I would be wearing a coat in which case the Velcro on the waist band fits perfectly. Remember also beside the Velcro on the waist band, there is the adjustable seatbelt material belt that had a snap closure in the front. So that can be tightened as well. You dont want the whole waistband to be too loose though otherwise the backplate would be flimsy and the camera will move around. The tighter the better.

That said, I was scrolling through a woodworkers Instagram feed yesterday, and it was incredibly satisfying to see photos of just the simplest, stupidest, outofcontext stuff. A shot of a unique tool. Some screws. A few pieces of wood. The carpenter rarely posted more than one photo a day, and each one couldnt have required more than a minute30 seconds if there wasnt a descriptionbut it really added up. I realize youre busy, but its quite frustrating to seehear nothing for a month, then be told the schedule has to change. Im honestly a bit skeptical of the new fulfillment date, and Id certainly be happier about having to endure another extension if I dont have spend the next month in the dark. Hopefully another extension wont be necessary, but either way I hope you might please consider giving us just a little more access.

4366,931585099,23,"According to IP address lookup, that IP points to an EC2 node in the Amazon cloud.  I dont use EC2 all of my cloud work is on Azure but my understanding is that they are virtualized server nodes with unique IP addresses that arent shared with other hosting customers. In other words, if two websites are hosted at the same EC2 node then they are 100 owned by the same person.  Now the gotcha there is that the owner of a DNS registration can point it to any IP address they want. I could take one of my domains and point it to that server if I felt like it. So the fact that two domains point to the same IP certainly makes it extremely likely that both are owned by the same registrant, but doesnt prove it. If the two sites were both online at the same time while hosted at the same IP then it would be a 100 proven association. And both websites are online right now. Smartmaker.com displays an under maintenance page while all4makers.com simply responds with an ascii OK on port 80. So without a doubt, these two domains are owned by the same registrant and that registrant is using Amazon EC2 as a hosting provider.

We will certainly offer the heated bed as an upgrade in the future. We havent had the opportunity to test the Polymakr filament as they just ended their Kickstarter campaign.

The first step is to build an organization, Privly, that can build and protect the protocols as they develop. The organization model I am looking at is Drupal. They have an effective open source development model, where profit httpwww.acquia.com comes from knowledge of the underlying system rather than designing the system around a revenue model. We mention our desire to distribute the data via P2P in our Road Map, but we need more developers if we are going to build this functionality. When you submit uniquely identifiable links to a website, that link becomes something the host can use to track you. Our plan is to either build a network of trusted hosts that dont keep logs, or preferably decentralize data distribution in a way that guarantees browsing privacy. We have a solution to make it easy and automatic, but we need more people to contribute expertise if we are going to distribute hosting. In short, Priv.ly does not need to be a central part of this system, and we will work to make it an optional piece of the privacy framework. Thanks for the Pledge! Sean",,,,,,,,

4425,944294769,30,"Graham  You wish for me to concede that a tool that is being developed as an educational tool and a scientific tool is a toy to be used for fun and not for experimentation. This is a concession I will not make. People have the potential to abuse tools, but this is not the fault of the tool or the toolmaker. I can use a hammer to break into a store, but this does not mean that hammers are unethical because they can be abused. Lets not talk about the potential for abuse  which is clearly possible with any tool  but rather lets talk about the purpose for which Backyard Brains intends this device. Asking me to pare down the discussion to the narrow interpretation that you have given to it is an interesting way to win a debate, but it is not the best way to get to the truth. As a philosopher, I would hope that truth and knowledge is you goal, and not winning a point. I do not see this device as a toy for fun, and it is my most sincere hope that others will approach this device in the same way. You have repeatedly used the dog analogy to  in your words  tease out what we, meaning you, find wrong with this device. Lets keep that distinction clear. We may both find the use of this device wrong when it comes to a dog, or not, but this has little if any relevance as to whether this wrongness can be equally applied to any living thing. I could just as easily ask you whether its wrong to electrically stimulate an amoeba, but the question would be equally irrelevant. But, for the sake of argument, lets consider why surgically modifying a dog could be wrong. A dog feels fear. It feels confusion. When these two things are combined, it feels terror. Psychologists have demonstrated that dogs show learned helplessness. When subjected to a terrifying experience repeatedly, they will shut down. Furthermore, a dog possesses sentience. It can tell itself from others. It can even recognize its reflection. There is no evidence that arthropods have these complex emotions, which require complex brain structures that they lack.",,,,,,,,

4427,944294769,36,"There are a few arguments here that bothered me. So much that I felt I have to temporarily back this project in order to be able to voice my concerns in a posting  not only about this project, but about kickstarter allowing something like this as an actual project. What bothers me 1 Not being able to voice a concern without backing the project. This also goes out to Rob Jacksons comment below, complaining that Paul Dutch was violating Kickstarter rules. This may formaly be true, however this should not be accepted as an argument, because it would mean that there can not be an open discussion about the ethics of a project. Only backers supporters of the project that do not intend to drop the pledge would be allowed to have an opinion. That is not enough with a project like this that has wider ethical implications. If this would be the intention of the kickstarter rule, the rule would be deeply flawed in my opinion Cheer or shut up. At least the temporary backing as a workaround should be accepted by creators, backers and also by kickstarter. 2 Even if the creators themselves do not kill the cockroaches in their experiments or think their treatment of them is not torture to them, they have no control over what some of their backers will do to living animals also on other insects than cockroaches or even small amphibians or mammals trying to take this a step further on a boring sunday afternoon.... The ethical problem for me lies mainly in this uncontrolled distribution of a questionable science toy involving the use and mutilation of an animal, regardless of our perception what we think it can feel or not. A cockroach is neither a potatoe nor a bacteria. It definitely has perception and a complex nervous system  this is after all the aim of this project to control a nervous system. What can be gained in knowledge Nothing, as the result is already known. In general it is ok to repeat experiments for educational purposes, but not in this uncontrolled DIY hombrew manner with living creatures. Science in this context would be only an excuse for anybody who feels like it to utilize an animal for fun sooo cool  and that is definitely not what responsible science is about. How Kickstarter can allow this as a project section hardware is beyond me. For a while I thought that this might even be a meta project  a scientific study conducted on kickstarter to see if people would actually back something like this and then reveal that it was meant as an eye opener, like the milgram experiment or the stanford prision experiment in retrospect. If this is serious, and not pulled before the funding period ends, kickstarter just lost a lot of love from me. And to other backers I do not want to judge you. Maybe you are a responsible being and you do not have ethical problems with this project  thats fine with me, I dont know you. But even then, do you think that this kind of experimenting on live animals should be distributed without any restriction on Kickstarter",,,,,,,,

I may begin looking at how to add a control surface onto the vehicle to make that a possibility, but its certainly an engineering and programming challenge  but one that I look forward to taking on. If completed, it would certainly be the first time its been done on a high altitude balloon to my knowledge. Stay tuned! You might see some interesting new drawings and ideas in the updates section.

4440,950821175,295,"Krister  That is an interesting comment on portability. It is not really something we thought of in the design process since the whole point of Transporter is you can put it literally anywhere with an Internet connection and still access all of your data from anywhere. Care to share more details on how you plan to use it We have been completely blown away by the International interest and will obviously be discussing plans to address in the coming weeks. For now, the best thing for you to do is to sign up at our Website to make sure you stay informed for when we do expand internationally httpwww.filetransporter.comcontactus Best, Jim",,,,,,,,
4441,950821175,323,"Hi Jim Hope its you, Thanks for the quick response. I think the Transport is different than what is out there in my terms. I know the Transporter can be GREAT if sharing between friendsclients which is my plan is possible without them having their own Transporter. I back the Early Bird. My plan was to have the Transporter as my own sharing system. Letting my clients access certain files without having them purchase a Transporter of their own. Still a cool device. I might back out or might add a 2nd3rd4th5th Transporter. Question  For those who are the Early Birds, if we wanted to add additional Transporters, can we just increase our pledge per. 149 per. additional Transporters This is just for the Early Birds. Thanks, Kris",,,,,,,,

4444,950821175,68,"Not sure if anyone else is having this problem, or if its just me, my Transporter will not format the hard drive. I have attempted with two different HDs and neither will format. One drive, an 80 GB Samsung drive, was previously used in another system, so it had information already on it. When I plugged it into the Transporter and left it alone to format lights blinking green and blue for over an hour, I took it out and plugged it back into my computer and the existing information on the drive was still there. So I purchased a new WD Black 750GB 7200RMP HD. Same result. Based on the FAQ, the format should take, approximately 10 minutes to complete. After 2.5 hours, the lights were still blinking green and blue. I powered off the Transporter, moved it to another outlet and plugged it in again. WD drive sat there for another hour, still not formatting. I tried again with the 80GB drive which a friend is using in his Transporter without problem and the same issue happens. Not sure why a company, which just launched a new product would choose to do support Monday through Friday, but that is what Connected Data has chosen to do. So, I guess I will have to call, from work, on Monday. Not really happy with that. I agree with other backers, there are a few things that need to come very soon iOS app, folder permissions, and the ability to support 3.5 drives. I hope to provide better information on Monday, once I get to talk to support. Im just hoping the unit is not dead and I have to return it. Hoping for the best. Glenn",,,,,,,,

4500,969890999,23,"Hi all, Firstly I would like to apologize one again for the frustration that our poor communication might have caused in some of you. Keeping up the pace of messaging across different fora turned to be quite a challenging task. Regarding shipping  We use DHL to ship internationally from Denmark to ROW.  We use UPS for bulk shipments to the US office  domestic distribution in the US is handled by Ryan in SF  We use Post Denmark to ship within the country. So far almost no devices got lost in the UK 1 box was delivered empty and we shipped another device to the backer free of charge According to todays numbers we are short of roughly 100 units we are planning to ship them during the next few days. Another lesson learned for us logistics and distribution of single units to such a scattered group of people is a big task, we were not really prepared for. We really appreciate having comments coming from all over the world, from people training in different conditions and with different expectations. Really really a great learning experience. Concluding we are really working hard to put your devices in your hands before Christmas, and we believe we can succeed. thanks Cris",,,,,,,,

Space people listen up Those of us that have asked for photos we wish we could all be pioneers... what kind of data do you want from us I am thinking we will need to know flight paths, trajectories etc so that we know what our scope for taking images actually is. Also, I saw the spec sheet on the camera  I take it from this we are to determine what we can actually do with the camera  or do we go to the manufacturer for questions Curious also about lens and filters and light and how the heck we take images from space... after all, may not get another chance!! cheers Helena",,,,,,,,

4563,981402963,257,"David Mulder Im not a surgeon but Ive played a bit with a da Vinci robot and Ive observed surgeons in training with the robot. There are probably many factors that determine the feel of the system. Ive heard one surgeon referring to the controlled robot instrument as his hand after only half an hour of working with it. You are correct that there is a form of tactile feedback, but  as you mention  it is independent of what the robot does I assume one could simulate it by putting a mechanical spring between your index finger and thumb. Thus, if that makes a difference which I doubt, it would probably be easy to provide this form of tactile feedback when using Control VR. My point is if you only want finger tracking to simulate the control of a da Vinci robot, the finger tracking of Control VR should be fine. In general, of course, tactile feedback would make a huge difference.",,,,,,,,

4680,1010535635,6,"Got my Chroma and UPS calculated the EU VAT for me plus a brokerage fee of approx. 12, Euros thats what I call money for nothing or payment for remote calculator . Nevertheless  it works and installation on iPad 4 was fool proof. For those who miss a documentation I did not find any in the package Install the Chroma App, activate Bluetooth on your iwhatsoever device, press the white button on the Node looks like a cut out U and press the pair button in the App  thats all. To calibrate leave the cap on the chroma sensor and press the calibrate button. And the cap of the Chroma sensor is very VERY tight fit. I wondered if I should better use a beer bottle opener German beer bottles need an opener . My summary Nice device, excellent solution, working App. A real Kickstarter. George, hopefully youll be able to make some money out of it or sell your idea for a bunch of bucks to a bigger company. Canon Nikon Sony Adobe Anyone  Another positive aspect in most cases Kickstarters or other companies outside the EU forget to include an invoice fixed outside the package which is needed for EU custom offices to calculate the EU import VAT 19. Parcel service will hand over all packages with a missing invoice to a custom office. Which in most cases mean that one have to wait additional 5 to 10 days and to travel to the next customs office with a printout of a Kickstarter web page or anything which looks like an invoice and hopefully will be accepted by the customs officers  this did NOT happen with Chroma.

4683,1010535635,52,"This seems like it could be very useful, but for me I know it cant be accurate enough to reproduce colours as you see them under sunlight. Metamerism httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMetamerismcolor causes colours to look very different under different light sources, such as sunlight to fluorescent or LED. Its a big issue in the cinematographic and art display worlds, and causes most people to cling to their halogen lights and gels for colour sensitive work. Ever wonder why you look so bloodless under white LEDs even ones that arent too blue  this is because LEDs only have very orangey reds and not the deep reds that blood reflects, so it makes us look too green and cant be counteracted with filters. If you do insist on not having a black body radiator ie halogen to your project for longevity  efficiency reasons, at least consider adding specific deep red and cyan LEDs to the mix to counter the effects of the reduced spectrum. Remember you can not correct for it in software later, because if you turn up the reds enough during calibration to make a human look correct, then a red apple will look like an overly vibrant orange, so you set the colour orange to be more red and lose any accuracy in that range, etc. There are also problems with the colours around cyan. Please feel free to message me if I can be of assistance. By carefully tuning the filters in front of your sensors you can sidestep the biggest hurdles.",,,,,,,,

4685,1010631065,358,"BlamJam, I was wondering the same thing as NightPueo. How do you know Also, I wonder if maybe you have a Marlin Sprinter settings or slic3r config problem where the extruder is maybe pushing too much filament too fast. If you are able to get the filament to extrude by hand, the same should be true of filament pushed by the hobbed bolt. Some pictures might help too. Perhaps you got a badly printedassembled extruder assembly that is guiding the filament poorly. Also, what temp are you using I use 215 to 235c for the extruder. Did your nozzle look cleannew when you got it They can get clogged. I clean mine in acetone for a few days, shaking the bottle a few times a day, and then with a thin metal guitar string advice from Tim Elmore of Filastruder. Did you already check that you are using the right sized extruder tube Matt included both the 3mm and 1.75mm in my kit. If you are using the 3mm for 1.75 mm filament, that extra space may be causing the melted ABS to squish up least resistance rather than down through the nozzle.",,,,,,,,

4687,1010631065,973,"Hey Guys, Ive been slammed with other projects, but I finally connected with Matt yesterday afternoon  Long story short, despite promising to ship 5 kits per week he decided to fabricate large lots of specific parts. For the last week, hes been milling the rest of the acrylic panels, he said he would be done with everything but the Big Foots by today so assume next week.  I said So it sounds like were going to get to a point where you run out of things to fabricate and the kit shipping will go really fast to which he replied yes, the only other thing that needs to be fabricated is the longer hobbed bolts for the double xtruder kits I asked what else was required before that happened, he said he still needs to assemble and solder all the extruders, and I believe there was another part he mentioned but its escaped me. He said at the current pace he should be through all the fabrication in two weeks of six daysaweek. Talking with Matt over the last few weeks, I believe he is sincerely working very hard with limited resources towards shipping all backer units.",,,,,,,,

No plans for VR web browser at this point but in the future  who knows  The backers will get the whole package of our apps, the ones that are now available on Google Play Store. Of course, there will be the freedom of choice between Android or iOS Package. And sure, there will be Full Screen mode in the app.  We believe Cmoar will be compatible with OSVR but it largely depends on our future collaboration with them. Our SDK will be for free and very easy to implement by the developers. We believe everything will speed up as soon as we release Cmoar on the market. The apps will be created systematically. After VR Cinema has its premiere, were starting works on a new app  What it will be is a tiny secret of ours The team is still developing so there will be more and more apps  london  were still working at the design and want to make it more attractive in the final version  Adding some color is being taken into account, it really is Unfortunately, we cannot share any information regarding our future AR plans, as we have signed the NDA with some company. Looks very promising, though  The vest is a brilliant idea! D And no children, of course  David Lenz  yes, thats a common problem. Dont worry, we pay a lot of attention to the comfort of use and the user shouldnt feel any discomfort after using Cmoar a couple of hours. Jeroen  nice to have you here and thanks for the support!  The apps for iOS will appear very soon, beginning with Cmoar Virtual Cinema in less than 2 weeks  Hendra  Start Chart will work great with our 2D lens. Maybe if we could establish cooperation with its developers, they could add SBS image as well  Fabian Alejandro Vargas  the Pad will be equipped with the inbuilt sensors, its own IMU and will be compatible with VR games and apps that our Studio creates and intend to create  Were talking here of course about both Android and iOS applications.

The problem with the Raspberry Pi is that it doesnt have full OpenGL support which is required to run Blender. Since the software to drive the printer is run through Blender, you wont be able to print directly from the Raspberry Pi. Perhaps with some help from the open source community, it would be possible to get Blender working on the RPi. Since the printer is largely being controlled by the audio output, maybe some of the work could be done without Blender, in which case youd still have to do part of the work on a Blendercapable computer, but could offload the actual printing time to an RPi.",,,,,,,,

4789,1032121365,1,"Another brain fart... Those batteries search ebay for BR435 or fishing lure battery and the LPLC should both fit inside a typical arrow. Now, add a forcegauge or something in the tip, and it could light up green if its a solid hit, maybe... Unless theres an accellereometer that fits also. Imagine an arrow that lights up AFTER you release it, then gives a flash as it impacts, or slowly dims if not. an accellereometer can be made by a tube of resistive film, a small spring and a small ballbearing. Fasten a wire to each end of the film, then the spring and ball also to one end. roll the film into a snug tube around the ball and spring. Not very accurate, but it should be able to indicate sudden, brutal changes. The real trick is in getting the light to the outside of the arrow.

I unhidden it to configure but then when I hide the SSID again, the Kepler goes offline. Is there a way to still keep it sync when SSID is hidden 2 Cant change between 12h  24h clock formats and check daylight savings. 3 Under settings  I had to log in to your site to register. Is this so that I get message of alarms from the Kepler Or is there more too it that is not done yet 4 I tested the GAS from my stove and it works indicating the level and alarm sound. Then it alert the APP. I then tested with the Kepler being offline by turning off my WiFi on my phone and the Kepler shows offline. When Kepler alarms goes off, it do not update my APP when its back online with WiFi. So to me it seem useless unless your phone APP is always on WiFi and online. So if I am outside of my home WiFi range then the App will not alert me. Isnt the Kepler connected directly to the home WiFi that was configure and not sync with APP on the phone It should be able to store all alerts even offline till it gets back online to update APP automatically. I havent tested out the CO part yet. So far only positive things is that the Kepler looks good and has good looking package but lack in the APP and functions and Sound is not loud enough. Should have volume control and display dimmer. Also the USB wire that hangs out to plug is not to clean looking. Please contact me or provide source code and I will try to figure this out more.

4903,1057053661,4,"I would like to say that the product this company provides is a great one for the price. Yes, mine did defect yesterday which I commented below about, but up until that point I thought these earphones were great and was disappointed when they had the internal disconnect. Once I had the issue I posted the comment and displayed my disappointment like many others. This morning I was surprised to see an email from their customer support apologizing and looking to make things better for me as a backer. A small gesture like that to me goes a long way. It shows that a company not just listens to their customers but also stands by them as well as their product to make things better. I did say that I was not willing to try again without an explanation, but because of a simply gesture of a kind email and great customer service Ill be glad to invest in this company again and again in the future.",,,,,,,,
4904,1057053661,14,"Ive been trying to contact them for a week, with no reply at all. The sound style didnt match my taste, so I want to return it.

4911,1057752953,18,"Hi, 1. We are working on getting that changed. Kickstarter doesnt let us change the shipping price if anyone has already selected that shipping destination. Weve asked backers with international shipping to temporarily change their shipping to US so we can make the modification and now were just waiting for everyone to do so. If you could please also temporarily change your shipping to US we would really appreciate it. If for some reason we cant get it changed, we will find another way to get you the tea time early bird with 25 shipping. Thanks for your patience while we sort this out! Erin",,,,,,,,
4912,1057752953,15,"Hi Matt. Glad you liked the update. Arent Flutter and Blynk awesome Theres so much cool stuff happening in this field right now. Anyway, great suggestions on improving the project writeups. Right now Im just doing high level project overviews. Between the end of the campaign and our ship date, I plan to expand on the projects with detailed instruction and documentation. That said, Im happy to answer any questions you have about it. Here are some answers to the questions you mentioned already Wiring up the valves is really easy. The two wires on each value connect to a pair of terminals on the motor drivers. so the first valve connects to terminals 0 and 1, the second to terminals 2 and 3. You can find the Open Sprinkler Pi software here httpsgithub.comDaninCAOSPi A plugin is just a small piece of code that runs inside a larger application. So in this case, its a python script that we add to Open Sprinkler Pi so it can communicate with Modulo. Hope that helps! Erin",,,,,,,,

4925,1059068312,7,Hi Patrick  how difficult would it be to substitute a different reader board into the circuit Is there anything that would absolutely stop me from swapping out the 125kHz RFID unit for a 13.56MHz NFC reader,,,,,,,,
4926,1059068312,1,"The RFID123 demonstration video here at kickstarter is really good. I watched it, and then I was able to make my board do everything that I saw in the video. And it just took me a few minutes. Great. I am very happy with my RFID123. Thanks for making this great little thing.  I feel that I should replace the ACDC converter though. I am afraid that it could catch fire some day.",,,,,,,,
4927,1059068312,2,"I received my kit in Norway today. It seems to work well. When I hold a card close to the reader, the LED flashes and the buzzer beeps several times. Great. But it was somewhat unexpected to see gray smoke come out of the ACDC adapter. When I plugged it into the mains, I noticed smoke. I unplugged, and tried again after a while. Gray smoke again. I saw smoke the first three times. Now it has stopped smoking, and it is actually working fine. ",,,,,,,,
4928,1059068312,10,"Thanks a ton, Lloyd! I really do appreciate your continued support. All units will be properly tested prior to shipment! All chips tested prior to kitting! One thing though. the outputs are 5v compatible ArduinoTTL compatible. The output can easily be modified with two resistors to being the voltage down to 3.3v RPi compatible. I will add this into the user manual when done. Thanks again for your support, Lloyd! Have a great weekend D",,,,,,,,
4929,1059068312,6,"Hi Lachlan Thanks for the question. Unfortunately it wouldnt be at all compatible. Most NFC and RFID readers use I2C or SPI ro communications. This one uses the RFID Wiegand protocol. Even if SPI or I2C were the method of communication, there are many different chipsets for 125kHz and 13.56MHz RFID readers, and different chipsets for NFC readers, which would all have different command protocolsregisters, etc  Warm regards, and thanks again for the question!

4935,1060828669,15,IMU FOR GUN SENSOR PLEASE,,,,,,,,
4936,1060828669,7,"If the headtracking worked like a Joystick like EDTracker or was compatible to opentrack, the experience would be much better in my opinion. Or some kind of switch to change the tracking method mouse or joystick. That would be great.  Also I think there would be many tools and games out there that are compatible to AntVR, if the DevKit was available to the public. I would love to create some games that are compatible with AntVR, but with only mousetracking its a bit of a pain depending on the scenario. The guncontroller currently is kind of useless from a gamedev side of view. Mainly because the the thumbstick doesnt allow simultaneously moving forwardbackward and strafing leftright. Pushing the thumbstick in the topleft, topright, bottomleft or bottomright corner just doesnt do anything. Some of the promised features are still missing at the moment, like the onesteppositional sensor or the gunmovementtracking e.g. aiming with the guncontroller although that DOES work with the provided zombiedemo. Again, sadly there is no public access to the SDK to develop games that use the gunsensor. I am really looking forward to the new lenses. I hope, text will be better readable and the whole display will be visible with the new ones. ",,,,,,,,

This will add an arduino that supports USB and the ability to program additional features that you personally want. I plan on adding a buzzer to alert me when smoke is detected. I also plan to add thermistors to detect the temperature ramping up from a fire inside my enclosure and trigger the necessary hardware. So advertise this kickstarter to your friends and lets see if we can get it to the next level.,,,,,,,,

4943,1060904411,21,"Im very impressed with the build quality, the design of the printed pieces including the very functional builtin support and the overall integration of the project. I do have one question about sensitivity I was trying to trigger the detector with the smoke from blowing out a small candle, and it seemed to work once, but then not again. I also noticed that the system tends to turn on with the first press of the button, then switch off a few seconds later the second press keeps it turned on at least for as long as Ive waited. Should I expect the sensitivity to be such that a candle would set it off, or will it need more",,,,,,,,

4979,1067365635,28,"Mike Yes, but project costs arent linear like that. Some things, like server costs, go up when you hit a certain set of criteria. E.g. at work, we use printer management software. I dont remember pricing, but lets pretend licensing for 100 users  1,000. We ran out of licenses as more people used the printers simultaneously. The next tier of licensing 10,000 for 400 users instead of 4,000 for 400 users like youd expect. These exact prices are ficticious, but the increase really was that dramatic in fact, it was many times bigger than what I quoted here, simply because we stopped being small business and started being enterprise which came with support and other things as part of the package. Same thing applies to cloud hosting. The more resources you require, the more exponential your costs become. And same for manufacturing. You might find a manufacturer who can build 1,000 units for X amount of money, but cant build 10,000 units factory not big enough. So you have to look elsewhere. Another company could do it, but maybe at 20x the cost, instead of 10x the cost. Then there might be parts shortages, rebuilds I think the Buccaneer 3D printer had to scrap perfectly good parts because of a faulty timing crystal. A factory worker opened the window and let smog in, tainting the crystals, unexpected delays e.g. rewriting in Go because node.js was too buggy and uncertainty of extra funding. Sure Ninja Blocks could have asked for what amount they REALLY needed, but they wouldnt have met their goal. Ever seen a Kickstarter ask for 1m and reach it You see more companies asking for little and telling investors We made 10x as much as we asked. Theres clearly demand! so they can get the rest of the money they need So no, I dont think the funds were mismanaged. Not to such a heavy degree. I sat with these guys at the pub and asked them all sorts of rather blunt and candid questions about running a Kickstarter and what the future would hold. Theyre very talkative after many beers, wines and tequila shots, and I saw no reason to doubt them when they said they were working for peanuts.

I have to agree with Brett that we need an update or refund. The fact you are able to log onto kickstarter but will not give us an update means you only care about the projects you backed and not the one you created.

5062,1087222369,42,"Hello guys. Id like to say Im sorry for the long delay and unresponsiveness. I was able to order and receive the flash drives and tshirts. 3 days after the project was funded we got hit with multiple tornadoes and sustained massive damage to our home. Weve lost almost everything and have been staying with relatives while the insurance adjusters take their good ole time with our claim. Just a few weeks after this we got hit with a pretty fierce blizzard  most of you probably did as well. We ended up losing our family vehicle in an accident. I have no ETA for anything at the moment. My computers where backed up with Carbonite and when either I can afford or the insurance pays for our lost items Ill be able to restore our videos and eBooks and get things out the door. Im very sorry guys. Some of you maybe live in the Midwest and have experienced the same tornadoes, and I hope you had better luck then we did. As of now I only have my cell phone or the library computer to get access to the web. Youre welcome to send messages and I will answer them when I can. If youd like a refund you can request one through Amazon and when I get back on Ill process the refunds. Again, Im sorry guys.",,,,,,,,

As for other potential ways to fund the project Where I come from, the local companies go out of their way to sponsor various projects, and I believe they most likely would have bought multiple Advertisement rewards if you were guys from that place.

I did it by myself but I dont recommend that for anybody. Here is my setup with a 58 TV.

This is one of the other reasons we need to get a large number out there the figures we need to prove it. From our trials in Brazil it was shown to more than half the numbers caught on hooks there. But of course across the world different species are caught at different depths. Our pods open at the moment at 15m or so, this will stop turtle bycatch in some incidences but not all. We very much want to look into this more and know we can adjust the opening mechanism to hopefully work for turtles in the future. This is the first step but watch this space. Hookpods for turtles may not be too far away if we can gain some momentum. Thank you so much for your support. Becky x",,,,,,,,

5175,1118609261,31,creator....I think the 2nd generation of the 6th finger should have switchable modes i.e. Mode 1 zoom inout every 5seconds....Mode 2 jog updown every 5 seconds....Mode 3 jitter updown constantly. I think for games like clash of clans it would be better if it moved the screen up then down every five seconds instead of jittering the screen like it does now. It is a good product and quite handy for using in between raids when training an army. You do have to be careful with placement though even in the trophy screen....mine managed to mimic hitting the home button twice bringing the iPad out of clash and onto the next available open app which was the settings menu.....luckily I spotted it doing it before it changed anything.,,,,,,,,

I believe starting temperature is taken care of by having such flexible variation. I am not sure how much difference a closed loop would be but if i am at a trade show and your there i will stop by and let you show me. I dont think having a cool down button is necessary for changing tips as i would just use a pare of pliers to swap out. Your ergonomics are definitely a huge plus fore someone who does allot of this.

On top of that SmartWater does not help the normal person who wants to see if a bicycle is stolen because they would need to have a black light to check if a bike has had SmartWater put onto it. Furthermore, you can go get your bike indexed for free at a bike shop which makes it a much better model than having to shell out extra money for an additional product. In terms of solving issues both would work great if everyone used it, but as a business model the bike index is much more likely to succeed because i it takes advantage of features on the bicycle itself to uniquely identify a bicycle ii it is cheaper, thus increasing incentive for everyone to use it and iii it is not named after a sports drink. On top of that you can get a really sweet looking bike jersey while helping to prevent bike theft. SOLD.",,,,,,,,

Android is a great leaping stone towards .NET programming and Windows Phone 78. Java is very similar to C, and the Silverlight XAML that you would build for Win Phone 78 user interfaces behaves similarly to the XML you would use to build Android user interfaces.

5333,1147574965,35,"Trying again today without changing anything the InAiR setup managed to complete successfully. My guess is that something was changed on the InAiR servers because the httpbox.inair.tvdeviceKSR0000000000setup URL is now being fetched successfully rather than failing with a 500 error. Unfortunately Freeview was not offered as a content provider choice... despite being reassured that it would be prior to backing this project. I ended up selecting Freesat as the closest match because the setup would not complete with None selected. Hopefully there will be someway to update this choice if Freeview support gets added later, but I cant find any way of changing it at the moment. What works  Twitter After a couple of attempts this managed to connect to my account and it provides the usual minimal features timeline, mentions, favourites, mentions and profile all readonly. However, these do not autorefresh which makes having them on the TV rather pointless. As a minimum I would expect the timeline to automatically show new tweets as they arrive. Ideally I would have liked something that allows a search query or even just a single hashtag to update automatically, e.g. something resembling httptwitterfall.com or like a stock ticker.  Tracks Manages to identify music being played and provide reasonably relevant information about the artist, including ability to play related videos. This is probably the only vaguely useful feature of the InAiR currently. What doesnt work  Facebook API problems acknowledged on the blog.  Guide No support for Freeview, so this doesnt provide correct information. Anyway the interface is atrocious every other TV guide that I have access to is much easier to use.  Key words Always seems to say No Data Available!. Entering keywords manually doesnt seem to help, even after eventually finding the Done button hiding under the keyboard in the iPhone app. The entered keywords show on the TV but the InAiR doesnt do anything else with them.  InAiR Remote The iPhone app is a complete nightmare. Strictly speaking it works, but it is an uphill battle. It doesnt connect reliably to the InAiR, and even when connected it is completely unintuitive. It is running on a very powerful platform with a twoway highspeed radio link to another powerful platform, but it ends up being much harder to use than an old fashioned IR remote. As a minimum it should be able to provide some feedback about the interactions that are possible at any time. Even better would be to show some content on the remote, e.g. a live mirror of the overlays being shown on the TV. This control interface needs some serious work to be usable. Overall, this is a complete waste of time in its current form. Hopefully software upgrades will be able to resolve some of the current issues... but for now it is being packed away.",,,,,,,,

5338,1150671832,27,"Hey So Ive got my Reflow oven assembled and running. I built per instructions, though I dont have an aluminum tray yet. It seems to work great, except that I think its getting WAY too hot. Im running with the target temperature of 240C per recommendations right. The yellow capacitors darken a little, but the PCB itself turns dark brown. The flux turns dark brown. Ive tried in various parts of the oven, and no matter where I put it, it turns the boards dark brown like that.httpdrazzy.come20141221134401.jpg If I watch it while its running, the solder melts around 220C according to the ControLeo2. So Im baffled  its as if the temperature is being reported wrong, and it thinks the oven is cooler than it is. Do you have any suggestions on what might be causing this Im sure I could crank back the temperature, and get something that would work, but Id rather have it work normally with accurate temperature reporting and all that.

I received one of the prototypes today, and have already spoken to Martin about it. Currently hes looking at making some changes which will definitely benefit all backers. One of the first changes will be the inclusion of a volume pot. This means that youll then be able to use it with any digital audio player using a lineout fixed voltage output  and control the volume from the amp. You dont have to sue a lineout, but you will have the option if you desire. Some of the things that amaze me at the moment is how little heat is being generated this is truly portable because of this, and also how clean the signal sounds.

MakerMex  Its awesome that youre offering free shipping with the MM1 to those of us in the U.S. Its nice to know youve covered a sticky point for some wouldbe backers. In regards to other forms of covering your backers, is there any expectation for offering a warranty on MM1 parts Obviously mechanical parts shouldnt self destruct, and usually once electronics are tested theyre good for nearly an eternity, with heat or moisture being their biggest enemies. But in the unusual circumstance when I may turn on my MM! and nothing happens, or if a heating element stops performing, or the LCD gets scrambled and it only displays alien hieroglyphics, what are my options and under what period of time are they available Aha! I noticed the 3D Sketchfab addition to the main page, then found the other head renderings on your profile. Interesting. So whats your opinion of the Photolum material Im guessing the phosphorous quality works fine, does the material pose any unique considerations or is it pretty much a setitandforgetit filament Glow in the dark is an age old quality that seems to find its way into numerous toy lines. Its not a huge draw for me but Im sure its a lot of fun for the educators out there. Speaking of stick filaments, since the MM1 is geared towards spool filament, is there any special trick to managing stick filaments when printing besides just creating the segment length needed for your model and letting it drape across the table or floor Im curious if you have found methods to contain it better. Do you have any photos of prints youve done with the polycarbonate or aluminumbased filaments Speaking of polycarbonate, that would require the hightemp extruder Im sure.

Sounds like this is the crux of the matter in deciding PhantomGoPro vs. something else. Perhaps postcampaign, would help to see more examples of GoPro maps at maximum zoom on manmade objects and from various altitudes, to see if the detail that one would require is achievable from GoPro, and at what altitude. The few examples given on the samples page do not look promising for our purpose in terms of details on manmade objects at maximum zoom, and these are not GoPro. For example, green roof blurred, edges jagged. What more had they been GoPro. Could be that the altitude was too high, not sure.",,,,,,,,
5399,1161526391,27,"No files are needed to georeference the maps. The entire process is completely web based and simply requires the user to identify points in their raw images and associate them with a point on a known basemap. In the absence of a good basemap, raw decimal GPS coordinates can be entered. Example When uploading your images, a user selects an image that has a recognizable region or object in it. Right clicking on the map will draw a marker on the raw image at the location that was selected. Then, on the basemap Google Maps or simliar, the user can find that same object and drop another marker. This pairing or points is called creating Ground Control Points GCPs. The more GCPs that are created, the better. An OK georeferencing job can be done in 510 scattered points, but a good one can be done in roughly 30. The number of GCPs required scales with the size of the map. If a user is georeferencing an area that has already been mapped in their account, they will be able to do the additional layer much more quickly. Using the previously collected layer as the basemap, along with the previously identified GCPs, it is easy to reassociate the points to add a new time layer.",,,,,,,,

5405,1163339523,31,"RichardAll, couple of observations after using mine for the past week. 1. The files are not date stamped all are dated noon, 112000, so when you pull up the directory its very difficult to tell which file is for each trip. Seems sort of odd, since the GPS knows the date  time. And of course when you read the files into Google earth, the timestamps are there. 2. I noticed a number of times the sync light would flash red and green. Not sure what that means, but it seems to say, Im not working powering off and back on resulted in an immediate GPS lock and green light, and then all is good again. Just not sure about what flashing redgreen is supposed to mean. 3. Ive already ordered an external battery box, BTW, it fits nicely inside a Pelican 1010 case. with room i hope for a set of external batteries. As prying this guy apart to change the batteries is a challenge. NOTE nice touch on the design to include the holes for an external power supply. Thanks. 4. It eats rechargeable batteries after about 4 hours, hence the need for 3 above. But regular Energizer batteries last all day havent tested them to failure so Im not sure exactly how long they last. Other than that it worked great.",,,,,,,,
5406,1163339523,42,I prefer actual technical questions directly unless it is a user related issue like this so everyone can see how to use the device properly. You need to wait for the GPS to start blinking green and it will record. Blinking red means there isnt a GPS lock. It can take up to 15 minutes for the green LED to blink and it must be used outdoors. The fact that you are seeing log files on the SD card means it is working but doesnt know where it is at yet.

5426,1169192398,6,"Hi Michael, We are sorry about the misunderstanding. Feel free to return the Handibot to us in the shipping box and we will refund you the full reward cost and the cost of shipping both ways. We hoped to have communicated that our Kickstarter project was all about developing new ways of running small, smart, CNC tools with joboriented apps  and, hoped that we had described the road map of getting from the current stage of running a Handibot just like a fullsize ShopBot to a more convenient system that would be mobiledevice oriented. Our videos showed the Handibot being run by a PC, usually a tablet on the back of the tool but any PC will do. The reward description indicated that the Windows PC was not included. Our goal for the ecosystem of apps is that ultimately these apps will operate the Handibot through a new open source motion system that runs through the Handibots control system and a thin user interface that connects the tool to the world. The development of the new control card for this system is described at www.shopbottools.commApplicationsdevelopers.htm This new system will make the development of direct connections to mobile smart phones and tablets much easier. At the moment, though, we work through a PC  whether the PC is off to the side of the Handibot and tethered with a USB cable or is strapped to the back and is itself communicating with an app that is passing instructions and running the tool from a mobile device. PCs large and small have been in the workshop running ShopBots and other CNC tools for the last 20 years. Yes, one does need to keep them out of the dust, chips, or filings ... but they do a surprisingly good job of enabling digital fab equipment and empowering people to do some amazing work. So ... again, sorry for any misunderstanding. Feel free to send your Handibot back. Regards, Ted",,,,,,,,

Toaster ovens draw a lot of current, easily 9A when powered from 115VAC. All of the SSRs weve seen that come in within our price range have losses which are 10W or more at those current levels. With 1015W of losses, we would need a large heatsink, holes in the case for ventilation, and maybe a fan or some overtemperature protection systems or something. Its possible to do, but it starts to get complex pretty quickly. After a lot of thinking, we decided that a mechanical relay would suit Reflowster better. Were always looking for ways to improve our design though, so please keep these comments and questions coming so that we can deliver the best product possible.",,,,,,,,

This product will allow pet owners to make sure that they can find their animals at night with no light which is a HUGE safety benefit for owners. PLUS if an animal should get loose, its easier for any drivers to see them thus making sure they dont get hit by oncoming cars. And should you be looking for your dog at night, trying to see the vest is a much needed benefit.

Im always getting stopped by other dog owners asking where they can get something similar and a local reporter even featured her on a news segment her LED collar was Seahawk themed for their last sendoff. Did I mention that my dog LOVES the attention. If you think the pup in the video is abused then Evalyn, you need to go spend some time working at a dog shelter to see real abused dogs. If you claim to do that, you are either lying or honestly have no clue. You are missing the whole point of a product like this. The main point is animal safety combined with a bit of fun. Evalyn...is your dog shorthaired and do you walk them often When its raining and cold out, do you cover them up with a dog vest If not, you need to check out the abuser in the mirror.

DLP based printing would require Netfab studio Pro with the slice commander add on to be incorporated into an engine...this would put the price of a DLPPrinter engine around 1800 give or take...Unless NetFab decides to change their policies. What envisiontec uses is not so different.....Materialise built an engine for them using Magics as the core adding in machine specific features to let it run the system.

I have called all of the big shipping companies, and we keep getting the same answers. The TarDisk and the components we use are so valuable we are afraid to ship them without insurance  proper tracking. There are some options, but if TarDisks go missing during shipment we will be in trouble. Here are some International shipping price examples. We are working with a shipping company to get bulkpricing, but we need to know our volume first. We choose the third option 1. USPS First Class Mail 1.10 Global  No Tracking at all. No insurance. Envelope can be 14 thick, so no protection for Tardisk, 45 week delivery time. 2. USPS First Class Mail 2.29.  No Tracking after it leaves US soil. No insurance. Envelope and be 1434 thick, so very little protection for Tardisk, 45 week delivery time. 3. USPS Priority International 24  Full Tracking. Price does not include insurance over 50. Good room for protection  7 day delivery time.",,,,,,,,

We have multiple cloud services in a box a dropboxboxshopify combo at release, everyone else has one. 2. We grow as one large storage pool a true cloud, everyone else has to grow as many different buckets for you to manage 3. We have a global network of exchange, for all devices to optionally participate and come together to rival any of the datacenterbased networks e.g. Twitter For specifically the project you mentioned, that one is a basic server with some 3rd party NAS software installed aka about 5 of the features we offer. As they mention themselves, a lot of the work in managing it and setting it up is shouldered on the user. If you are very technical and understand how to install Linux packages or use the commandline efficiently, then that one might be more for you. Our product is streamlined for people to easily use, in addition to the three differentiators I listed above  I hope that clears things up!",,,,,,,,

5638,1209284858,1,"chris Wow, we hear your frustration. 5 days seems to be a long time indeed. Can you tell us if you had ANY experience with Arduino before using Blynk We usually get tons of feedback that its less then 5 minutes... Actually, you dont need to know how to code to use Blynk. However, it would be great if you know how to install libraries and how to upload sketches to Arduino. But thats Arduino basics...youll have to learn them on your own. Our Getting Started sectionhttpwww.blynk.ccgettingstarted has all the links needed for the first run. Pins should be assigned in the app only  if you need basic functionality. I recommend you open our examples and read the headers where everything is explained. Start with the BlynkBlink example. We know that documentation should be better and we are working on it together with a few video tutorials. Sorry for the delays with it, but we are just limited in human resources. You dont need any scripts on your phone, no root certificates unless you want to run your own server, which is, lets agree, even sounds like something for more experienced users. Connecting over USB is a bit tricky for newbies and we search for ways to simplify it. So the possibility is there, but the experience definitely needs update. Please see our forum for tips on how to get it running. It would be easier for you to use shields if you have any. Ethernet shield might be the cheapest and easiest option for you. Please check the list of supported hardware and choose one which you have httpcommunity.blynk.ccthardwaresupportedbyblynk16 We would love to hear more feedback from you, because it will make Blynk better for less experienced makers. Please do so on our forum  its super friendly and all the issues can be answered in 24 hours. Sorry for any inconvenience, we are working to make Blynk better and easier every day.",,,,,,,,

For the demo I used a USB to MIDI dongle to accomplish that. But for the final release I will be working on a method that will send MIDI data over the Papilios USB port so no MIDI dongle will be required. Additionally, since all the MIDI functionality is defined in the Arduino sketch running on the ZPUino it is very easy for people to hack in any behavior they desire. Its easy to link functionality to an analog slider, a serial message, a light sensor, or anything you can dream up! Jack.",,,,,,,,

Do they attach to the main arm tower If so, does it attach on top as to maintain the full 8 range of motion I assume that the 90 degree section attach to each other, if so, how 7. It is mentioned that the FLX.IDE beta comes included, wondering if there will be a separate charge for softwarelicensing after the beta is over, or if as a kickstarter backer we will continue to use the software free of charge after the beta period is over 8. It is so hard to know what kind of attachments will be needed and it sounds like there is a lot still in flux on that end of things. Is it possible to order attachments at the same rate even after the kickstarter is over Sorry for the lengthy list of questions. This device has so much potential, I am excited to collaborate with the group and make it even better. Happy to spread the word.",,,,,,,,

5766,1239090607,2421,"Kickstarter School  No. 7 Project Updates Project updates serve as your projects blog. Theyre a great way to share your progress, post media, and thank your backers. Posting a project update automatically sends an email to all your backers with that update. You can choose to make each update public for everyone to see, or reserve it for just your backers to view. BUILDING MOMENTUM While your project is live and the clock ticking, keep your backers informed and inspired to help you spread the word. Instead of posting a link to your project and asking for pledges every day, treat your project like a story that is unfolding and update everyone on its progress. Pics from last nights show! or We found a printer for our book! with a link to your project is engaging and fun for everybody to follow along with. SHARING THE PROCESS Once your project is successfully funded, dont forget about all the people that helped make it possible. Let backers and spectators watch your project come to life by sharing the decisions you make with them, explaining how it feels as your goal becomes a reality, and even asking them for feedback. Keeping backers informed and engaged is an essential part of Kickstarter. CELEBRATING SUCCESS Sharing reviews, press, and photos from your project out in the world  whether its opening night of your play or your book on someones bookshelf  is great for everyone involved. The story of your project doesnt end after it gets shipped out. You still have a captivated audience thats cheering for you. Communicating with them can be one of the most rewarding parts of the process.",,,,,,,,

No photos, no videos, no examples of code. Just 5 updates a year on a project we successfully funded more than 2 years ago. I was more confident when you admitted you needed help on certain things, but nothing seems to have come of that, and I dont believe for a second there wouldnt have been many people of various skill sets wanting to help this project reach completion.

5776,1240864642,15,"Hi Anthony  Thanks for your feedback. I am so glad you mentioned higher education as a possible area for Quick Key. Its funny you mentioned the Student ID field, because this is an area that has gotten a lot of attention from our teacher Champions, who have been helping us with the beta. Right now, the Student ID is a 4x5 matrix, to allow for over 1,000 students to be identified. We do have some ideas for a better student ID. and some people have even voted for the feature custom answer keys which would allow you to design your own key and print it. That way, you could use any student ID you want as your Quick Key ID. Anyway, awesome suggestions. Please keep them coming. And thank you for your support! Walter",,,,,,,,

5778,1240864642,17,"I encourage you to broaden your marketing a bit to include college and university teachers. As a PhD student, I teach courses and upon graduation will be teaching lots more. I know that I and other teachers in higher ed give lots of quizzes and would be thrilled to have an easy way to grade them and populate scores into our grade books. As such, we comprise a pretty large additional customer base who could help to make this app a success. Also, there is no place for openprompt feedback in the survey, so I say this here instead It would be great for the student number to be 5 digits. We commonly use the last five digits of students ID numbers as their identification number within the course. There are duplicates at the 4 digit level, but not at the 5 digit level. Thanks a lot, and good luck!  Anthony",,,,,,,,

5990,1283465070,42,"I may be stepping on some toes here, but support for Windows Phone is like supporting 3 of the world market source IDC httpwww.idc.comprodservsmartphoneosmarketshare.jsp. Its a bit unbusiness like to invest resources in something that has this few supporters. Lets face it, Microsoft missed the market of phones, and, according to me, should be ignored so that they can be phased out, despite the few nice phones that support Windows Phone like the Lumia series. With respect to that, I would suggest to change the order of rewards 75K for the mesh support, which may be of incredible value to people wanting to deply a network of sensors like detecting climatic conditions in several places in the house , 100K for the Windows phone support and yes, obviously, I do not have a windows phone device, lol",,,,,,,,
5991,1283465070,23,"Creator  very cool, thanks I will check out the blog posting. Sounds like you have things well in hand, and my cautionary tail probably wasnt needed! ",,,,,,,,
5992,1283465070,47,"Vincent The board has 32K RAM, of which 8K is taken by the Nordic SoftDevice. That leaves 24K, some of which is used by the Spark firmware. I dont have the exact numbers, but the Spark FW doesnt use a lot. We werent going to include a coin cell, shipping batteries becomes another hassle. The battery shield has pins coming out the bottom for easy breadboarding, so you can hook things up that way. I imagine it may be hard to put anything further on the battery shield given the size of the coin cell. The Proto shield will work quite well for that.",,,,,,,,

Mine seems ok so far, only complaint I have at the moment is a dirty looks like finger prints on the inside of the lens. Seems there is no way to take it apart to clean. I have no problems with the dust cap, its just a simple swap over for me. Considering the amount of time this has taken, I would have thought that there would be no quality issues and it seems that that there is no feedback form PLX at the moment. There is no doubt that its a very good torch, maybe a bit too high tech to be reliable. I think the next upgrade should have a better button layout and different colour buttons to the body. Scrolling through the display should have a separate button rather than pushing two buttons at once. Also the LCD display should be horizontal so you can read it without turning the torch to the side. Maybe build it into the torch head rather than the body. Overall, pleased with mine.

6072,1302749989,156,"Im no expert Dylan, but yes, 12 should be totally possible in timber, but perhaps not in one pass depends on material density and hardness  check the Stepcraft guidance with your machine. Several passes would be required in soft metals, but it isnt designed for hard metals. There is plenty of guidance on the Internet, but perhaps first imagine yourself using a handheld router. First of all, handheld routing soft metal isnt very safe  especially for the inexperienced metalworker  almost certain to end up in disappointment and perhaps serious injury. Even if you could hold the router firm enough, you would never drive a 18 bit down 12 deep in aluminium ... it would break the bit for sure and is dangerous. A 14 bit would be required for a 12 depth in timber, but its still dangerous. If you tried to freehand an outline while plunging the whole 12 at once, youre likely to break the bit andor throw the router across the bench. Herein lies the beauty of the Stepcraft CNC. The Stepcraft can accurately retrace its path, so for 12 depth you would probably use a 14 bit in several, progressively deeper plunge cuts and then make a shallow finishing cut around the perimeter using the side of bit to remove any minor steps left by successive plunges. No need for special cooling with aluminium provided the cuts are progressive ... it transfers heat away very quickly  a lot of it in the metal chips. Brass is harder, but also relatively selflubricating, which is why it makes reasonable bearing material. Dont forget that 2D or 2.5D is way faster for profile cutting that using the 3D software  the Vectric site has a great guide for CNC beginners. Ive rambled on long enough, but I must say that I dont want my previous posts to understate the Stepcraft in any way ... I think its totally awesome for what it was designed for ... which is pretty much everything I would want to do in my home workshop. I cant wait to get my hands on one and start profile cutting aluminium shapes for my project !! Congratulations to everyone involved !!",,,,,,,,

6074,1302749989,205,"stefan Here are the answers to Hendriks questions... Hello. I find this project extremely confusing. It looks like a really great product but the description and reward levels are not exactly easy to follow. E.g. the title talks about a laser but that isnt actually offered at any reward level. Erick  The Laser will be available this year fall but we did not have the final pricing and info to include it in the packages, however we will issue a discount code to all backers when it is released so you can purcahse it at the same discount that we applied to the packages on Kickstarter. The opening paragraph makes a big thing about an ATC but its not mentioned anywhere else in the description. Erick  The ATC is in the UPDATES section  there are photos and a video. We got this info after kickstarter began so we had to add as an UPDATE There is a table to describe the differences between the different models from 210 to 840 but nothing to explain the myriad reward levels which seem designed to confuse. A nice, clear table that shows exactly what you get at each reward level would be really helpful. Along with at least a brief description of what those items are and what their capabilitieslimitations are. Erick  this is a good point and we did not realize this was going to be so confusing until we launched and get 20 emails a day. So the best I can do is ask you to pick a package that best suits what you wish to do and then let me know any modifications that you wish to have and I can customize it from there for you E.g. if I pledge for an 840 table with a hot wire cutter where does it tell me that actually I wont be able to cut 840x600 because the knife has a limited depth Erick  you are correct and again I am sorry for the confusion. There is a limitation to the hotwire cutter which maxes out at 3 cut depth Do I need the tool length sensor to do any milling at all or is it only required when using the ATC Erick  The tool length sensor can be used with or without the ATC. if you are manually changing bits then it comes in handy. But you do not need it Presumably the exhaust adapter is a vacuum extraction attachment Erick  yes that is precisely what it does. Can it be used for any spindle or is it dedicated to the HS Spindle Erick  You can use a Dremel, proxxon or our HS spindle. However we will have adapter for others like the Dewalt, Kress, etc in the next month or so I currently have the Proxxon milldrill system BFW40BFB2000KT150. It uses a standard 43mm collar and I have an adapter to use my Dremel with it. I have been planning to upgrade it to a CNC system for a while but obviously a ready made system is a lot easier! If I got a Stepcraft, I assume my Proxxon spindle and Dremel adapter will work Erick  YES it would Would there be any advantage to getting a HS Spindle as well other than the increased power Erick  The HS Spindle is meant for longer duration runs, more control over the RPM which is controlled by the Gcode optionally by the knob on the front of the controller. If you were going to cut alumimum, then I would suggest the HS spindle.",,,,,,,,

Im no patent lawyer but to me they all have enough variance to be argued in court. Generally if you follow the Apple, Samsung,Google and Motorola lawsuits it ends up in one paying the other if an actual patent violation is determined. I cant see any injunction and Click patent request was filed around the end of last year, I believe before the others and besides the three projects here have been playing nice. Its the ones from Indiegogo that came here and didnt play nice. Worry about how to use your watch when you get it and which free band to select from your pledge and dont fret the legal side.

Good practice would be making an initial contact with the submitter and letting them know what state their ticket is in with each update. Another basic practice is to complete the quicker and shorter tickets first as you can minimize the ticket queue the quickest and then focus on the older and more troublesome support request. With that being said the response at around 9 AM CST on Friday the 27th was Shipped which would imply that the package was on the way to me, being only 8 hours away and having received the printer in 4 days under even worse conditions Christmas deliveries, expecting it at 6 USPS working days USPS does deliver on Saturdays seems reasonable.

Since I would like to have the ability to pick which 2 axes will be dynamic and which one will be static e.g. slidepan, slidetilt, pantilt, I am checking what hardware I currently own and what I will need. In that context, I realized that in various picturesvideos you are using one or more spacer blocks to lift the tiltSpin by a few cm higher than the horizontal plate, in order to provide more clearance for a tilting camera. In the prototype 6.5 picture it looks like you are also using such a spacer to attach the sliderSpin. Therefore what I would like to ask is  do you include 1 spacer per Spin  or do you only include 1 spacer in AL2  in that case, could more be ordered as accessories Thank you and good luck!",,,,,,,,
6136,1316166382,22,"Hello AXSY community. I would have happily paid full retail for a TSet, its a bargain at that price. It is the first motion control rig to check almost all my boxes, and even boxes I didnt know I had. The concept of quiet, powerful little motors with built in batteries controlled without wires is brilliant. So adaptable. This is why I chose to put my money in now, and take the risk that the product somehow doesnt live up to our enormous expectations. I want to have a voice in the process. I read all the comments carefully before investing, and the considerate responses from the creators to all the great suggestions by other backers convinced me that I should take that risk. So here is my only unchecked box on the grand list of features Joystick control, with dampening and ramping easing adjustments, for real time control at moderate distances. Even if it required a cable between the Centric and the Joystick it would double the usefulness of the Spin motors. I hope it is already in your plans, if not, please give it a thought. Lastly, I offer a hearty seconding of the motion to develop the focuszoom version or adaptor for the Spin. That would be a game changer as well.

Yes it can charge via port and sun at same time. Both ports are rated for 2A but with the IC we currently have they will charge at the optimum rate. So yes, 2 ipads would both charge at 2A each. Hope that answers your questions. Abdul  The cells are indeed coming from China but we have not deconstructed a Chinese product to create our own, we just source our panels from there. As mentioned, with 20 efficient cells, they will most definitely charge from indoor light, just at a slower pace or not at all if the light isnt bright enough. As for daisychaining  yes, technically there is an efficiency drop adding more units in a chain. However we see it being a minor reduction compared to the convenience of being able to charge multiple units from the same input either solar panel or outlet.

Were still looking into offering some kind of streaming service but I do not dare to say anything until our programmer can confirm that doable. Cedric we can definitely take a look at your headphones but all the samples we got back for this issue were working properly. It would actually make me very happy if your headphones makes more noise than others because then we can just exchange it with a working one. What Im afraid of now is that that some people are much more sensitive than others since we can only barely hear it ourselves. If you connect your headphones to your laptop, press play and then pause. Do you hear any noise or is it only during silent playback Dieter Same thing goes for you. We can take a look at your headphones to see if it really is as bad as you say. If it is, then we will exchange them with new ones.

The efficient of DSP is lesser than expected. iOS app crashes often. There is weird silent area in the end of each track. Sometimes cant adjust volume from the touch interface. And many small problems. I am a bit disappointed with this result. At first it must be necessary to fix bugs on the iOS app. Also, if there will be no improvement on the sound tuning derived from DSP, I will recommend to buy the other branded Bluetooth headphones.",,,,,,,,

6218,1337697702,13,"Other notes for those receiving the LaserInk You need to make a cable to go from GND and D11 pin on the GRBL. This is usually used for spindle control. By default your GRBL doesnt have a header installed here. I STRONGLY recommend that you install a pin header here, so you can connect to the laserink head with confidence. If youre not comfortable with soldering, get a friend to do it. Also DO NOT TOUCH THE SIGNAL LEAD WHILE THE LASERINK IS PLUGGED IN let me say that again, for emphasis DO NOT TOUCH THE SIGNAL LEAD WHILE THE LASERINK IS PLUGGED IN Due to the way the signal is sent to the laserink, the laser will immediately fire at FULL POWER if you touch the signal lead. Again, this is NOT GOOD FOR YOU. Dont power on the LaserInk head until all your wiring is properly connected and grounded. The last thing you want is to get permanently blinded by blue laser light just because you touched a signal wire. That is all ",,,,,,,,

All the abilities that the gun in the video was shown doing are 100 guaranteed to be part of the final version, regardless of stretch goals. The guns will ship with about 10 red LEDs, and 10 blue ones. The reason RGB LEDs are a stretch goal is because they cost 1 per LED, which is insane. Again, I want to apologize for any misunderstandings anyone may have had from our video. In fact the reason we placed RGB LEDs, and the gametype building programs as stretch goals is because we dont want to promise anything we cant deliver.

The reason why I created the 300 and 600 pledge is that I thought  maybe there is a lab out there, which has some idea which they want to test for their own publication. In that scenario, the 300 or 600 is super cheap assuming it helps them get a publication, its ridiculously cheep Same with the data  if you can use my raw data in your publication, then 90 is really not that much...

Similarly to what you said in that your last comment to me. It is important to either live up to that promise or give another heads up though, otherwise we become worried again  And generally, the longer the time is between each update, the bigger each update should be.

I am not sure about the BSX brand as you guys continually drop the ball when the arguably easiest part, that is, updating the people that gave you 40k of their money to help build your dreamproduct  you dont care or want to keep in the loop.

As far as I am aware all components are bought and paid for and sat in boxes waiting to be picked and packed. These days it doesnt take long to have a PCB printed or even a whole batch of 300 and if its down to the PCB then why no update saying that they are not back from being made yet.

My son, a Canadian Singaporean, had found learning JS difficult last year during his first year at university. He has to go back and do a second course on it, so I asked him to look at it and if it would be helpful to him. He said it would be helpful.

6487,1397680579,1608,"James, we need to kick this along. Some suggestions for small mods to appeal to a broader market. 1. Implement itemfinding functionality. Using brainwave force field tech, you just think to yourself where are those bloody keys and it tells you in the sock and undies drawer, dope. 2. Add a retinal nerve probe and TV antenna. Backers just get a 4.25 hole drilled into their skulls, insert the probe, say clearly Rolf Harris and off they go to the nearest relevant TV news. Suggest that a skilled home handyman is the very least required to do the drill thing. 3. With 2. above, deploy a special device that detects when the wearer is looking at their mobile phone screen while driving. If so, a punitive charge zaps through the head between the temples. Might need a small exhaust fan option to get rid of the smoke and the battery at the back might need a 10 power increase. Over to you now please.",,,,,,,,

6495,1402339637,175,"As a supporter for any product that is well designed and functions to conserve energy, globally, I eagerly anticipated getting my hands on one of these devices. The product has exceeded all of my expectations. Thus, I completely support and back this product. Kuddos to the founders of VL for this awesome new innovation!!!",,,,,,,,
6496,1402339637,8,Have these been sent out I backed the project and have yet to receive my chargers. What should I do,,,,,,,,
6497,1402339637,118,"I pledged 1 so that I could leave this comment. To anyone considering backing this project you should do the research first. A typical phone charger draws less than 0.1W of power while not in use, the figure varies from charger to charger, typically between 0.3 and 0.03 W, so lets take that higher value for the calculation. The US average price of electricity in Jan 2014 was 11.65 cents per kWh, or 0.01165 cent per Watt Hour. So, one charger left plugged in for 24 hours a day for an entire year would cost you 0.3W  24h  365  0.01165  30.62 cents. 0.31 per year in savings. Yet this product will cost you 25 on the early bird. On a personal level, completely not worth it. But Vampire Labs argument has been that if you add it all up over all the devices in the world, thats a lot of wasted energy. And it is. But that misses the point you paying 25 for one of these will only create One of them. It will only address the problem for your devices. And it would do so in a massively uneconomical way. It cannot be applied to the global problem spending 25 for every mobile device in the world, in order to recoup 0.31 per device per year would be lunacy. If you wanted to use this Vampire Proof charger to solve the problem across the entire world then the world would need to spend billions of dollars on them. Thats not a solution, thats just a good money spinner for Vampire Labs. But what about the CO2 Sure, so youre happy to give Billions to Vampire Labs so that they can save a few million from going to the energy companies, you just want to cut back global warming. Well lets take the worst US scenario and suppose that all of that wasted energy was coming from Lignite Coal Power plants. That process typically produces 2.18lb of CO2 per kWh. Our example charger from earlier consumes 2.628kWh of energy in a year, and so produces 5.73lbs of CO2 per year. So buying one of these products will save a little under 6lb of CO2 per year, for just 25. Great. But what else could you do with 25 Well one thing and this is just the first that I found from 10 seconds of googling is to sponsor a tree through the World Land Trust. Actually you could sponsor 3. It will depend on the species of course, but a typical mature tree locks up 48 lb of CO2 per year. So your 25 could be getting you almost 150 lb per year. Which is a little better than 6 TLDR. Phone chargers use a tiny tiny tiny amount of power, so small its literally not worth worrying about. The time and money put into this project could do much much more good for the environment and for your wallets elsewhere. If you want to save yourself money and the environment then grow a garden or donate to a charity to plant trees on your behalf itll do a lot more good in the world.",,,,,,,,
6498,1402339637,105,"Vampire Labs most people buy our product because it is a ecofriendly product. Like recycling, they do it because it is the right thing to do. Whats the CO2 emissions from the manufacturing from one of these chargers How long to they take to biodegrade . Recycling is ecofriendly because it helps reduce waste and pollution. I stick to my point that your product does not. It costs more money to buy than it can ever save. Its CO2 reductions are tiny and there are many many better ways for people to contribute to helping the environment for the same or less money. And its another piece of plastic and circuitry that has to be built in a factory and ends up in a landfill. . Abdul Ive taken readings from the 2 chargers I have in my house, a motorola charger and an iPhone 4 charger httpimgur.comawYWet My meter reads down to 0.1W with a 0.5 error margin. The moto charger draws less than my meter can reliably read so the best we can say is 0.1W or less. That iPhone charger is a few years old now, Ill take my meter to work on Monday and see if anyones got a new iPhone, Samsung, HTC, etc charger around. Everyone This product will not help. The presentation is deceptive. Please research it before you back it. The power draw of smart device chargers is not a new issue, people have been talking about this for years and the conclusion is always the same its not worth worrying about. If you care about the environment then buy a wallsocket timer thatll turn off your router at night and while youre at work, or buy low energy bulbs, or cycle to work, or donate your money to planting trees, or wind tech research, or anything else really. . my router draws 12W  if I turned it off while Im asleep  at work approx 100 hours a week then I would cut down my electricity usage by 62.4 kWh per year. 136lb of CO2  7.27 a year from turning off my router while Im not using it, as opposed to 0.31 from not using the iPhone charger. Amazon has timers for under 7  itd pay for itself in 1 year O In fact Vampire Labs, you could ship all of your backers a socket timer, Im sure for 400 orders you could get them for 45 a unit just tell each backer to use it with their router and you could potentially cut down 27 tons of CO2 a year!",,,,,,,,

6502,1402793428,76,"Hi Robert, I have checked out Smartquad. The short answer is, no, Pond will not be charged with Smartquad. A few clarifications to make sure we are on the same page  The battery inside Pond charges with a 12V power source, and comes with a 12V power adapter that plugs into the wall for charging Pond. Smartquad provides 5V via each of the USB ports, so those 5V sources can not be used to charge Pond.  It seems Smartquad is plugged into the wall when in use to charge any of the devices you are charging with its four USB ports.  Pond has a battery inside that provides power to the Qi charging circuitry. The Qi module runs on 12V. So, bringing the output voltage and charging voltage of the batteries as close to 12V allows the best battery life, due to optimal efficiency.  Last, if you have two wall outlets, Smartquad could use one, and Pond could use the other when it needs to be recharged. I hope this helps. We will be grateful if you decide to support Pond.

Once again PCR tubes etc seem more expensive than they should be. On the Gel box thing, they are really expensive, 500 is actually pretty sweet, the do it yourself one is much cheaper anyway! Just my 2 cents.",,,,,,,,
6518,1404597492,18,"I wonder if this wouldnt be best as a teaching tool. Not the device itself, but the building of it. If you can program the Arduino to get the cycling right, youve got the theory of PCR down pretty solid. It would be great to have more engineeringcomp sci students who understand a bit more about molecular biology. The center where I work has a lot of them and we spend a lot of time inventing the common vocabulary we all need to communicate. An undergraduate team could really make a neat project out of this.",,,,,,,,
6519,1404597492,19,"Dave  I agree with you that reagent cost is another factor, though Im not sure the primary audience of this machine is going to keep it running 40 hoursweek which changes the math a little, and for some users simply leasing may not be an option. Were trying to serve new groups of users, and I think youre right that as this new type of demand arises some new supply will as well. Were already seeing that in the DIYbio community where I know some efforts are underway to test lowcost polymerases including ones that can be shipped at room temperature and retail these at the prices and quantities appropriate. I also think theres opportunities for us to reduce cost via hardware and software. For example with the 2 Cs ramp time we are targeting, you can get the same amplification with less polymerase compared with what youd get with a slower eBay clunker, due to less enzyme deactivation. Integrated software can better calculate the amount of enzyme you actually need based on the specifics of your reaction and hardware. I think theres some opportunity around optimizing protocols like this  in well funded labs today people often just want to get a reaction to work and then theyd prefer to spend time on their project rather than figure out ways to save on PCR. Less well funded users will have different incentives and I expect well see further innovation here as these new users collaborate. Josh",,,,,,,,

Aside from that a developer at groupme wants to use them, as well as a few other projects which put in custom orders who I will not name yet as I have not asked their permission. One of the big barriers is tools which we are starting to build now. As we didnt reach our reach goals for them they will not be under the same license, but they will be OSS all the same.

We do have a sample implementation in Ruby with a GTK interface that may provide some reference but I must warn you it is very rough.

That said, we agree that we have been unable to provide what we initially promised and are prepared to offer you a refund for your pledge. So if you can just provide the email of the PayPal account you would like the refund to go to we will provide you with a refund of 85. We would also just like to thank you for all of your support up until now. We really appreciate you putting up with all the setbacks and delays for as long as you did.

Unfortunately theyll be on public holiday from tomorrow till Tuesday so we dont expect to get that shipment before Tuesday. Once we have it we can prepare shipping all preorders as well.

6707,1442392254,6,"Grady, When you are ready to do the lecture series please be sure to let us know what it would cost to sponsor you to lecture in our city. Im connected to enough local groups of Computer Scientists and the like that I might be willing to sponsor you to come here for one of your lectures and get people from my local groups to attend... and If Im willing to do it I expect there are others that are as well.",,,,,,,,
6708,1442392254,0,"Robert, my apologies for not replying to your comment! I dont often visit the Kickstarter site anymore, as the center of gravity of our work has moved to our public site here httpcomputingthehumanexperience.com Our latest newsletter is here on that site httpcomputingthehumanexperience.comcategorynewsletter and it was sent shortly after your post. I am in desperate need of the next newsletter, but weve been so consumed with actually doing things, Ive neglected writing about the things we are are doing! Expect a fresh newsletter soon did you get the Septemberr 2013 one We had emailed it out as usual but heres a brief summary! We continue our dialog with corporate PBS, who continues to express support for the project..we have certainly realized in this journey that public television is itself going through a transition, and trying to figure out what it wants to do in this age of streaming media! We have also been on a search for a productiondirection team to take us to full production, and we believe we have found them  a wellseasoned and wellrespected team in London. Currently, they are working on a new treatment for an envisioned series of six one hour episodes. Also, we continue our lecturing  Gradys most recently presented another Computing theme to the Computing Research Association, the group that represents the department head of most every comp sci department in North America. Finally, along with a team of a half dozen or so volunteers, that merry band has been busy working on a private web site and its contents, which we are using to organize our research materials and to stage some forthcoming features for the public Computing site. Thank you again for your question Robert, and thank you for your support and continuing interesting in Computing!",,,,,,,,
6709,1442392254,7,"You are right Tom! We dont know exactly what broadcasting will look like when this series is ready in 2014  it might still be network television like PBS, BBC or HBO, or it might be streaming over the web, or it might even be something that hasnt been invented yet or some combination thereof! What we do know is that Computing The Human Experience is going to be a world class production and it will be made easily available to people all over the globe  for computing is truly a global story. As for coming to Washington to do a lecture  there is always a possibility of that  but my lectures will also be put on our YouTube channel and possibly public television as well so even if I dont make it to Washington it will be easy for you to see.",,,,,,,,

6713,1444409174,113,"Hi Everyone, The pen ink level seems to be a common concern, but out of the 10k kits weve shipped less than a dozen have had an ink level problem. The ink level is based on the white ball, not the visible silver. If the white ball is right before the first e in electroninks then thats the appropriate level,  a few mm. If you look at Sparkfuns image of the pen you can see where this ball is httpswww.sparkfun.comproducts13184 Weve now fully moved from Illinois to Austin, Texas and have our temp workers kitting. We have close to 5000 kits that we need to add pens and workbooks to and then ship them. We have 700 maker kits done this morning with the rest to be done later today. Well then be putting shipping labels on them and getting those out later this week, completing all outstanding kickstarter orders before Christmas. Track our progress httpstwitter.comElectroninks J Anderson, yep we respond quicker to direct emails at kickstarterelectroninks.com Thanks for letting folks know. Casey, yep Amazon only has items weve completed for months now, not any of the outstanding ones for obvious reasons. Craig, yes your order is in our shipping queue with a maker kit  steel sheet. We do bulk shipping at first, so hopefully we have your kit  steel sheet out by the end of the week. Certainly domestic mixed kits by Christmas. Nikolaos, best method to contact us in through our ticket system via email  kickstarterelectroninks.com. We have 92 of all kickstarter orders complete and the some of the maker kits and a few developer kits are left. We dont have the resources of a large company to accurately forecast leadtimes, so when I give an estimated shipping date we truly think we can hit it, but are learning about the ways in which it is delayed. We are at the mercy of our factory in China for many of the kits, but thankfully we now have them all and can work on adding the pen and workbook to each and then shipping them out ourselves. Michal, please send us photos of your 10x pens. Are you measuring them from the white ball or from the silver Well make sure the pens meet our specifications and fix them if they dont. Joe, Im sorry but were doing our best to ship orders in the order of complexity and time received. We have this last bunch of orders to fulfill before we can all sit back and stop stressing that backers are going to eat us alive! I have reviewed your order again and it hopefully will go out this week if Brett who does all our shipping now in Texas can finish the bulk maker kits and work on the mixed shipments. He has to train new people, schedule new shipments, even sign up for internet and such in the new office. Thanks all  Michael",,,,,,,,

The full docs are available from Thingiverse if you want more info and the driver chip as I am sure you already know is a Semtech SC620. You should be able to drive all the LEDs at full brighness simultaneously. The LED driver chip will get quite warm, but not alarmingly so in testing, it got to about 5060 degrees on a warm day. However it is unlikely that you would ever need to drive more than 4 channels at full tilt at any one time, because you will be using either white or IR LEDs and not usually both at the same time.",,,,,,,,

Hi All at Acuity Responding to your reply in the Comments thread Thanks for your sincerely apologising  I think. It is true I do feel mislead. So much so that I hope you take this a bit further than sending me a quick twosentence reply about it. I get that you guys are really in the middle of a big intense project, with so many things to do every day. I have been there too. I can imagine it might begin to seem like those guys out there on the internet who gave us some money arent so important right now. And its true, in a way. Do your thing. But also, dont forget us, because without us you would not be doing this. And listen to us seriously when we voice concerns. We also care about your product. Anyway, back to my questionissue As I have already said, I understand the use of a few small printed parts in your machine, but this is a pretty high profile one. You may remember you featured it quite highly in a video during your campaign here httpvimeo.com79056147. And of course we will all remember your making a feature of the Exact Retract Extruder in your main promo video. This part of the machine has always been quite a feature. Do you really want to undermine it in this way, for all time, just because of a small in the grand scheme budget question Printing parts for commercially available machines, especially in this price range, this visibly, is, I think, a mistake. Not just for keeping meusyour backers satisfied, but for forming a coherent product and reputation for the future market. I am mailing this to you as I realise that all Kickstarter comments are visible to anyone without being a backer, etc. and while I wanted to discuss this publicly, I dont want to harm your public profile  so apologies for not spotting that previously. I hope all other aspects of the project are going well. Jon",,,,,,,,

Shipment dates for such a project would require elimination of ALL the uncertainty, along with a risk mitigation plan backed by a plenty of exta bank balance which we do not have. We are sorry for the state many of our backers did not expect, however, we assure you we have not stopped working on this project one bit, and again, we are in a much better situation today than 3 months ago. 1. It was nice to know that you were still around after three months of silence. 2. No shipment date update is not the lesson you should have learned. What you should have learned is to not be silent for three months. We understand uncertainty or if we dont, we shouldnt be supporting you on Kickstarter. 3. If you are in a better situation, then give more frequent updates monthly at minimum. We dont need technical updates but an estimate of delivery would be appreciated. December was original date, then March, now ... 4. PC technology that was acceptable in December 2014 wont be in December 2015.

What with the video presentation, working prototype, and 2 very senior PC industry executives with experience at the top 5 PC OEMs have agreed to join us to help Tango rollout and you have till now, nothing to show for it. Virtual office with the 2 very senior industry executives working from home Just doesnt tie together. You had a product, a fair few people and myself was interested in. So I think it is utterly disgraceful, that you put your time, face and name to this project, which at this point, seems to be going nowhere with no accountability on your part whatsoever. Kickstarter contributions are not preorders. These are contributions to bring product to market. If you had anything at all to show for it, well and good. But I have not seen anything substantial enough to warrant my continued confidence in this project. The stink from a bad reputation goes a long way on the Internet these days. Just ask Jon Atherton of HEX3. Would you still have the consumer goodwill and inclination if you ever develop your product Would anyone still be interested if you had any future products If anything, I have funded projects that have overran their deadlines and we were GIVEN the option for a refund, as the project was overfunded and the creators realised they bit off more than they could chew. If you need to understand how the project needs to be run, take a leaf from Earin, or Heatworks, you dont see people ranting for refunds of their contributions.

This was far from a donation and in retrospect, there are far worthier subjects who would have deserved the funds that were provided to you. this is a funding mechanism whereby companies are provided the funds to provide a product. The interest rate is factored into the discounts that are provided to us when we loan you the money months in advance of release. Anyone who paints kickstarter as a donation arena is one who is trying to sell snake oil. The lack of updates either here or at indiegogo shows a lack of professionalism that will not translate into success for your company. The comments may be read by those you are seeking additional funding from and those who you would seek to partner with. This is all to assume that you are not out just out to steal our funds and provide quarterly updates to appease the gullible and keep the suspicious at bay.

6811,1465283878,57,"Guy, How did you arrive at these findings If theyre true, then weve been bamboozled! I would agree with you if there had actually been specific UPGRADES and not visible DOWNGRADES in user interface, in configuration, in support, and in build quality, to name just the most blatant FAILS. Perhaps these idiots believe... Guy I dont know about idiots, but some skeptics would say, dont believe anything you hear and only half of what ya see. Having said that, according to the Feb update, they are saying they have implemented specific upgrades. Do the new LED they have chosen to use in production sound like an improvement The XY Resolution has been increased from 328 x 328 microns to 314 x 314 microns by collimation thus reducing high angles of incident UV light. Now we are at our maximum theoretical resolution based on 128 pixels and 40mm. In a private message from iBox, regarding the early betas, which I dont think theyd mind if I made public, they said as with any new product cars, electronics, etc, the first unit shipped will be less mature than the last. Its just a fact. I want to believe this, but it might make me look like an idiot. Another excerpt from the Feb update In late November 2014 we discovered quality issues with our LED vendor resulting in nonhomogeneous radiated power. This issue caused us to find a new supplier. The first supplier search took 3 months. This time goes fast when you need 1000 hours of UVLED test time over a minimum of 10 random samples. We do run this in parallel as test fixtures allow. We have selected a new LED vendor, albeit their LEDs are 10x the original suppliers price, but we had to absorb that price because the printer price was already set. Guy, If you are correct about visible downgrades please explain to me why anyone would pay 10X more for a part, if its net effect is a downgrade",,,,,,,,

Would my original OctoFire do that I dont have a need for an additional charger my original OctoFire does great for that, but something that charges and can transfer data to my computer for multiple devices at once that is useful. I am concerned about the new design, though. Is there enough space to fit two oversized items such as the receiver for my wireless headphones . . . which will not be hooked up to this . . . unless it would still work like that . . . and my wifi receiver next to each other. It appears that to flash drives would have no problem fitting next to each other. My computer has eight USB ports and it often seems like thats not enough. My mouse, keyboard, printer, wifi, headphones, and the external drive I almost always have connected to it take up seven of those the headphones take two one for a receiver and one for a charger, so if I could use this to transfer some of those off, it would give me a little more wiggle room. My original OctoFire purple, because thats my second favorite color and you didnt make my first always has cords hooked up to let it charge my flip phone, iPad 2, keyboard for my iPad, and iPod v.1. I love it. On the note of color, do you plan to make multiple colors when this explodes and you start multiplying your original goal If you do, please make blue one of the options. Its the favorite color of myself, my sisters, and my mom. I will totally take another purple one, if you go with the original colors for stretch goals again, assuming you do additional colors or even do stretch goals, but it would be cool to have OctoFires in my top two colors.",,,,,,,,

If you use really thin wires it does tend to heat up but using the wire in the video I didnt feel it getting hot. It may be the magnetic field causes some resistance... The tachometer is set for counting bright flashes, so it shouldnt be picking anything up on the black side. Id done a previous attempt with notquite so black on the other side, and the readings were quite spurious. With black on the other side, the readings are quite steady... Ive had the experimenter motor parts go flying quite a few times, and it was a lot less exciting than it sounds, due to high RPM, but very low torque. I wouldnt try it near delicate china, or with your face close to it, but its never caused anything close to dangerous situations. My 12 year old daughter has been experimenting, and I wouldnt let her play with it if I thought there was a chance of her getting hurt. Plastidip might be too heavy if we apply it to only one side.

6894,1481627393,31,Harry I understand the Trademark issue using the word Think. I wonder those become an issue when you include the power adapter that is used with the Lenovo. I really think that you will need to make this battery pack compatible with other power cords or supplys power cord that is used with the Zettaly battery pack.

6895,1482674211,34,"sgllama  The PowerTap boards feed power to only the output side of the board. Ground, Data and Clock, however are passed through from input to output with ground tied to the ground of the input power on the tap. You need to isolate the power line from multiple, separate supplies, otherwise it could damage the supplies and the strips. Each one is rated for 5A which is generally enough to supply a 5m roll of 32 pixelm strips.",,,,,,,,
6896,1482674211,31,"Dan Regalia  Interesting idea. Ive never seen a cube made with LED drivers like what the AllPixel supports. I think the biggest problem would be that the SM5050 LEDs typically used by the more common strips would prevent a seethrough 3D display... However! I could recommend something like these httpwww.adafruit.comproducts1734 Believe it or not, those are not typical RGB LEDs, but have a WS2812 Neopixel controller embedded in them. This would vastly simplify the wiring for such a cube since instead of doing all that weird multiplexing, you could just wire power and ground and then daisy chain the dataindataout however you want. This could be cool  In that case, yes, you totally could use the AllPixel... though BiblioPixel doesnt have an LEDCube controller yet P But it wouldnt be that hard to make LEDMatrix work with a cube.",,,,,,,,

6899,1482674211,36,"Brett Levy  The strips you link to have no chipset, they are what would generally be referred to as analog LED strips. Meaning that you light up the whole strip the same color and have no control over each individual LED. There are really no different than a single, passive, RGB LED just longer and with a ton of LEDs wired in parallel. These type of LEDs are not supported by the AllPixel. We do sell the supported variety as part of the kickstarter and they are also available from many places such as Amazon, eBay, Adafruit and many others though our prices are MUCH cheaper if you buy with your pledge. 680 pixels refers to each RGB LED on the strip. So each node is 1 pixel. The Lumin8 looks awesome. But is designed for the type of LEDs you linked to above. The analog variety. Although you could do very much the same thing with the AllPixel, but with control over every single pixel, not just the whole strip as the Lumin8 does. In the main video on this Kickstarter there is a 24x24 matrix doing an audio EQ animation and that is all done with the AllPixel and a little bit of software.",,,,,,,,

Had one minor issue but this turned out to be an issue with the source .stl I think and it not slicing properly so source issue otherwise this thing is brilliant. CEL, for a first shot at a 3d printer, you should be pretty proud. The Robox is a darn fine machine! Ive found the provided software to be ridiculously simple to drive which is great. But does anyone have recommended go to software that supports .stl, etc from a basic editor point of view Id like to be able to edit files to tailor or to be able to make designs myself.

Zeal Optics is our special partner for the Kickstarter campaign, so the goggles included in our reward packages are totally free. Were not charging any extra for them, so even if we didnt include the goggles, the price would be the same. Because of Kickstarters fulfillment rules, we wont be able to send you just the GogglePals, either. Maybe you could give them away as a birthday present, donate them as a charity raffle prize, or fill them with sand and have a mini zen garden.  When the campaign completes, the preorder price will go back to the original retail price without any other perks. Currently SDK is not available for this version, but were planning on releasing an SDK in future. Please stay tuned! Cheers, The GogglePal Team",,,,,,,,

6976,1500857161,24,"One more comment related to my previous questions... If you can still operate the shutters manually... Please make sure to include the functionality that shuttereaze reports that manual state change back to the controller instantly. This could be used for all sorts of neat home automation tricks. Such as If one shutter is manually moved to a specific setting, then the controller will set all shutters in that room to the same setting. Or combine them with other devices to trigger actions A simple manual close of one shutter in the bedroom could trigger all of the shutters to close in the house and all of the lights to shut off if it is done after 10pm. Obviously the above would require the zigbee or zwave solution, a controller, and more automated devices. However, the above requires shuttereaze to report instant status updates when the shutters are manually operated.",,,,,,,,

As I clearly stated it takes time, patience and the willingness to learn the physics involved. John certainly seems to have learned fast. To answer his questions Yes, shorting the distance will increase power but watch how much you lower the reflector. Believe it or not, the vibrations can bounce back hard enough to literally drill a hole through the threaded center area of the transducer. I did clover leaves and a dead spider I found on the ground. You can try living bugs but they tend to run around the table as you attempted to capture them with a pair of tweezers.

6986,1501277174,40,"A few thoughts I paid almost 18K for my epilog 45 watt laser that has a 12 x 18 cutting envelope. If I could DIY construct and equivalent system for 5K I would be WAY ahead of purchasing another laser I need one. I would be willing to pay 500 for robust control software alone, acquiring the motion control electronics and constructing hardware is childs play. Developing a robust, RELIABLE workable control is where the real task lies and is worth much more than any pledge you can make. HAVE FAITH!!! Ive been playing with my new air assist nozzle on my epilog laser and have found that I still get the same cutting capacity increase if I drop the air pressure down to 40 psi from 80 psi. It seems that the difference in cutting performance gain is largely due to switching from blowing air at the cut zone to blowing air through the cut itself. I also noticed that the at the location where the laser first pierces through the material it doesnt quite cut all the way through before the laser starts moving. The industrial lasers that I have used have an actual pierce cycle where they turn the laser on and wait for it to cut through the material before the cutting is performed. With a 100 watt system and a good air assist the laser will start to behave more like an industrial system and I think it would be prudent to include a pierce delay in the lasersaur control system for those who might need it! Another thought lasersaur control be able to interpret Gcode",,,,,,,,

The idea would be you would have an extra 2 pins for power , and a jumper that says whether power comes from the Arduino or from the external power source. I would imagine using this with a 5v9v12v combination power pack that provides 5v to the Arduino, and more power to the servos or motors. However with dealing with the bigger motors that need more power, it might be better to use an UNO instead and a traditional shield with external power like the Sensor Shield V or a DFRobot Romeo that provides a secondary power source on the main board. I wonder what types of things people are planning to do with the Digispark, and whether only a few crazies contemplate using one with 4 servos.",,,,,,,,

7076,1523215551,30,Im a pro member of the Instructables site and I think there is a small discrepancy on wiring the LED matrix. Since this will be the largest part of my effort I am laying out my grid for the LEDs. What I have spotted is on page 27 of the PDF. The Image Notes do not seem to agree with the image with regards to notes 8  9. They seem to be reversed. Whats even stranger is I noticed that in Step 11 of the Instructables website view of that same illustration the layout of the wire colors appears to be in the correct order. It looks like a really strange glitch in the way the Image notes are being numbered. I can only see the error if I look at the image labels on the PDF for those notes. I appologize for the size of this note but I wanted to be clear about what I was seeing so you could verify and fix if needed before the PDF goes out to everybody.,,,,,,,,
7077,1523215551,25,"Conrad, I see why our page numbers dont match. You are looking at the original Instructable that I posted last year. I would like to direct your attention to the updated Instructable here httpwww.instructables.comidInteractiveLEDBeerPongTable20 I provide a couple of ways to lay out the grid Step 13 and you can download the PDF from Instructables or here httpchexal.comwpcontentuploads201504InteractiveLEDBeerPongTable20Apr24.pdf Apologies for the confusion between the two. I have posted the links on the Kickstarter to the new Instructable, but I know that there were some news sites that did stories and linked to the outdated one. The good news though is that the new version is a lot easier to set up than the first version! A lot less wiring. haha I will still add more to the new version to make it clearer. Make sure to check it out on the Instructables website too, as there is a video there too.",,,,,,,,
7078,1523215551,8,"Seba I would recommend just purchasing an acrylic sheet that is frosted or diffused. It looks like that is the type of acrylic in your photo.

That being said, if it is too diffused, it wont be able to see the cup. Here are two diffused sheets that I have tested on the tables and work well. These do not have a protective coating on them and provide equal light diffusion across the whole sheet. The table in the CBC video also used one of these sheets.

7085,1526192434,64,"Based upon the changes and your work with the distributor do you still anticipate a November delivery I have a project in mind that needs to be complete by mid December and was wondering if I should move to a backup plan. A comment on the certification. You mention that it would have to be recertified if the antenna or power or sim was changed, but wasnt that the original idea of the two piece design That I would use the top piece in my design with no changes needed, thus no need to recertify I know these things are complex and full of pitfalls, but I am curious if you did certify and than I used it without changing any of the items you mentioned, would it still be certified",,,,,,,,
7086,1526192434,63,"Mark Not sure where November came into play, delivery is scheduled for December and always has been per the schedule provided within the campaign. If you have something due mid December, that choice is up to you. Any delay in our schedule would put you over and that doesnt give you any time to get stuff up and running. Regarding your certification question of the two piece  the original idea was that if someone used the top board, the cellular portion, including the provided SIM, power, and antenna they wouldnt have to redo PTCRB. But, the PTCRB changed the rules which invalidated the possibility to certify with headers or other integratable connectors and thus limited it to the shortlist I have on the forum. This happened after we had already gone through and validated that it was possible to certify  check out Multitech and Janus, they have PTCRB certified devices, but as of the last meeting, their product lines are crushed bc theyre no longer valid end products. Any integration has to be certified. Ill go into some further history in the next forum post I put up about certification, but the take away is that it was possible which is why we put up the campaign then the rules changed. BUT, if you have  5 items you dont have to do any FCCICCE and unless youre going to make A LOT of products, PTCRB doesnt necessarily come into play.",,,,,,,,
7087,1526192434,143," SparqEE thanks for the clear information guys is good to see KS is quite steady on the progress and i am sure it gets funded, i will raise my pledge to contribute for that. I have to say is quite funny when i saw your project here i myself am working in a similar concept with GSM technology although differs quite a lot from yours so probably have different audience but at this moment what i could say is even smaller than yours  . My plan is also launch in KS hopefully by October, but although is not appropriate to speak about it here, i do want to support you and make more this kind of GSM technology available to many people. i believe there is room for lots of improvement on how people use this technology specially in M2M and IOT applications Marco, It seems there are a couple of people with the same idea heheheh tracking is something i also want and been wanting to do for some time, in fact with GSM technology the biggest problem is always battery life and there are a couple ways to make it feasible, probably the most used one is running the GSM chip in intervals but if you get pretty short intervals is still a challenge getting out to last 1 month...if the SparqEE can do it kudos to them  just look to other similar commercial devices out there you will see they are big and usually never lasts so much.",,,,,,,,
7088,1526192434,79,"Mark No problem. I understand your suggestion and I havent sent out a notice yet so how would you know. Ill send an update early this week, but heres a little insight We did the 2pc prototype but still need to do a final run of the assembly with the production parts before we setup for the full run  i.e. moving to 0402s from the bigger parts that we developed with. This has yet to be done because were still working with vendors, getting the certification quotes and processes down, and working with the distributor. This process is taking longer than I had hoped, but we have some slop in the schedule to account for this type of delay. It will be tight, but were not delaying production bc of the 12pc issue  Im simply answering questions and corresponding to those who would like to weigh in. Chris",,,,,,,,

7095,1526432151,10,"I, too, have seen concerned backers posting and speaking with each other to inquire whether theyve heard any campaign information recently. The campaign admin wrote to me via Twitter when the funding goal was reached. During Thanksgiving weekend, I responded to his comment and added my own questionssuggestions through a Facebook message. I wasnt expecting a response during a holiday weekend, but he actually wrote back. Although his response was understandably brief, he merely wanted to acknowledge my letter. He promised to write back to me soon after, but I never heard further. I think hes been so busy that he must have forgot. Hes a good guy, it seems, so Im sure theres a logical explanation for the sudden silence  both in terms of my letter and keeping backers informed. I wont lie, though  I, too, am a bit disappointed. We have not yet received our campaign exit survey from Fasetto, which should have arrived soon after the campaign ended. Without this survey, they cant possibly distribute the rewards properly  like in my case, I pledged 40 plus an additional 5 so that I could obtain an extra software copy. As others have stated whether here, on other social media sites, andor via private conversations, we were initially promised December delivery. While it is still technically December, the lack of an exit survey coupled with the broken promise of preChristmas delivery as per Fasettos last Kickstarter update is concerning and upsetting to backers. Im not usually a stickler about campaigns meeting their deadlines exactly on time, especially knowing that all kinds of unexpected issues can arise however, I agree with others that an update to notify us of an impending delay would have been appropriate. My next question is this is the software still slated to be publicly released on January 15th or has that date changed Moreover, as backers, we were promised early access before the softwares public release. Whether or not that deadline changes, Im hoping Fasetto will somehow make up their lack of communication and delays to their loyal backers. I was hoping to be able to use Fasetto in time for my sisters wedding on Jan 5th, in order to easily swap and backup photosvideos. My iPhone has zero storage capacity the with tons of apps and files I have, plus the wedding hall doesnt have reliable reception, so I thought Fasetto would get me out of that bind. It seems like I need to find a backup plan for my backup plan, no pun intended. Problem is, theres no other solution out there like Fasetto.  Any alternative suggestions are welcome and appreciated!",,,,,,,,

Anyway there is a big assembly problem with this device, as you can see in the last photo of my flicr album httpsflic.krsaHsk2gkKDH, the wires to the piezo and the piezo itself are squished against the PCB on the components side so probably there was a short circuit that drained the battery and killed some components.

7143,1534859666,12,"A waste if money. Very cheap, supplied tools are a loose fit as they are just off the shelf. I think any mention of the tracker is just misleading as its a huge seperate keyring. The whole point of the omegakey is to tidy your keys, not add extra to them. I emailed my comments to the designer but was told I was wrong and there was no way I was able to get a refund. Ive thrown it in the bin and wont be backing another kick starter item as apparently you can mislead people about the tracker, take their money, and have no come back. Very disappointed!",,,,,,,,
7144,1534859666,28,"Well I received my omega key about a week ago and wasnt too impressed. The reason I chose to back this project instead of build my own as per the instructions on lifehacker was for the key finder. The keyfinder which is made by some other company doesnt have a working version of the android app so its still sitting on my desk. Apparently it will be updated sometime soon. I pledged for the everything kit and am not happy with the fact that hardly anything fits using the supplied screws. That was a major oversight I think as you expect to fit the tools and some of your keys when ordering. Instead only about 13 of my keys fit and none of the tools fit with the provided screws. So Im off to the hardware store to buy longer screws. Maybe someday I will be able to include the keyfinder if you get it to eventually work. Lastly, the Omega key strap is very cheaply made and is fraying after a week of use. I imagine I will have to buy or make a more durable strap which wont break and lose everything. So it looks like you guys cleaned up on this project, buying some cheap tools and key finder and putting it all together as if it were a kit you made yourself. Congratulations.",,,,,,,,

If I remove the resistor and solder a wire to the pad on the edge furthest from the inductor I could use this wire and the gnd pin to set the feedbackoutput voltage right While I understand and respect the no external components required design ethos, I would find a thru hole solder pad connected to vfb useful in a future revision to make externally setting vout easier.

7166,1546768987,1,Your pessimism does not help the situation and can you please understand that or I will just simply ignore you and spend my time explaining to someone who is an actual supporter. To the point. A Paypal Example. A user creates an account at Noteus site where they create a username and password combo. Through this account they can set up there Paypal account by logging in through Paypals secure site and granting permissions to Noteu through the oAuth protocol returning an access token. This can be used securely to access the users Paypal information that can be display via Noteu. The user can login with the username and password combo they created on site within Noteus application to login. This can then be used in a query to Noteus servers to verify who the user is and use the secure access token to query Paypal for the information which will be sent to Noteus application and then displayed on Noteus display. No username and passwords for users accounts will ever be known or stored and only access tokens with limited access will be stored securely on Noteus servers away from the users computer. Users will only have to launch Noteus application and should be ready to go. Im sorry for the lack of clarity during the video on Noteus workflow and take that as an improvement.,,,,,,,,

The list serves the purpose of having one consolidated visual public record, showing how many people are unhappy and fedup with Taylor. Its a handy reference for us backers, as well as the public, maybe kickstarter staff, maybe Taylors family and friends and hopefully Taylor himself. The only way Taylor can be informed of the list is if he reads these comments. I can also email him the list and send it to him as a kickstarter message, which I will do. But dont hold your breath waiting for a response or refund. I was promised a refund on July 10, 2014. That was the last I heard from Taylor, even though I have messaged him several times since. On July 11, 2014, Taylor specifically stated that if you want a refund all you had to do was send him a direct message with your correct email address and he would process your refund ASAP.

I may have missed an answer to this elsewhere, but is there an estimate of how the price compares to say OSH Parks services. Or could we get an estimate of a fully functional Arduino Uno made using a Voltera. For instance, if a person owned all the components needed about 7 then how much would an Uno PCB cost to print in addition to the 7 OSH Park costs around 20 for 1 Uno PCB without components, to make an unpopulated board. Although a very different service, OSH Park is still the closest competitor, for very small batches, that I can think of.",,,,,,,,

When doing it yourself you are relying on your fine motor skills to position that stencil into place, and you always get an offset! The VOne however has much finer precision than your fine motor skills at least mine. Prior to dispensing the paste, the printer will go through an accurate calibration sequence to find all the pads on the board. We have found it to be very accurate and have not had issues with misalignment and offsetting as you see with stencils. Katarina",,,,,,,,

7228,1562480378,139,"Hi Henner, Thank you, weve designed ZeroHours flashlight modes with your thoughts in mind. You will not have to cycle through all 6 modes when you use ZeroHour. Single clicks will take you through the four illumination modes, Low1, Medium2, High3, Maximum4, then back to Low1. Strobe5 and SOS6 modes are only accessible by doubleclicking the power button from any of the four illumination modes. Turn on the flashlight to any mode, then doubleclick to get to Strobe5, and doubleclick again to get to SOS6 modes. If you never double click, youll never see Strobe or SOS. ZeroHour is also programmed with modememory, meaning it will return to your last used mode when you power on again. Just power off by pressing the power button for 1.5 seconds when you power on, youre back where you were. This allows you to stay on your favorite mode, and youre never forced to cycle through the other modes unless you want to. Our PCB is not a DIY board and is not reprogrammable. We understand DIY is popular with our flashlight experts, and have added this and your momentary switch suggestion to our list for future upgrades. Thanks! Amy  Aaron",,,,,,,,
7229,1562480378,195,"Hi AJ, Weve been getting great suggestions for mounts, and we will add this one to our list. We should be able to make it much lighter since the battery backup is already on the flashlight! We are aware of painting with light  its an awesome photographic effect, and we agree, there is a lot photographers will be able to do with ZeroHours 1,000 lumen beam and 500 meter throw. And when your iPads out of power, like you said, simply plug in. You can even recharge your iPad and use the flashlight at the same time! Thanks, Amy  Aaron",,,,,,,,

Matthew  Yeah this shipment hasnt gone exactly as I would have liked, and any backers who added or upgraded to the Pro would be left out. This only went to backers who only ordered the Basic and the Breakout. It is a little bit of a bummer that those who supported us more are left out of this shipment, but no matter what some people would have had to lose. The next production run will be with Pro boards. I havent nailed down exactly how many we will make or how we will divy them up, but that will get sorted out in the next few weeks. I want to see how the first production run lands, and then I will finalize the plan. I know being left out sucks. I really dont like it. We just dont have pros and it wouldnt have done a lot of good to send out one board to some people. But I am working really hard to make sure this shipment lands well and that the next shipments come as soon as possible, so hopefully you wont have to wait much longer. Thanks. Taylor",,,,,,,,

There is another class of campaigns, that I wont name any particular example of here, where the creators just realize that theyre overwhelmed, bail on their investors and go silent. Thats the worst.

Have you seen fiber optic cable A light is shined inside a glass pipe and the light stays inside the glass due to the difference in dielectric between the glass and the air and the mode of propagation. Daisy sensors have the same property, the majority of energy stays inside the soil and is not radiated outside. Regarding sensors accidently talking to each other, In addition to the engergy staying inside the soil, a measurement takes much less than 0.1 seconds every 15 minutes. Furthermore, the amount of power used is approximately 3 orders of magnitude less than your cell phone or our batteries would not last  We bob, taun and I honestly have no idea which will win. as we will be placing 4 sensors into a plastic rectangle measuring about 9 inches wide and 2 long. thanks for your vote and comment and be sure you tell a friend about our sensors!",,,,,,,,

7293,1575674157,14,I really would like to buy an Xwinder kit. The problem is that imperial aluminium extrusion is completely unavailable here in europe.

7298,1575838234,5,"Im also particularly interested in controlling the device through the USB interface, rather than just reading the data in realtime. I would like to be able to synchronize the clock and startstop logging without having to physically interact with the device. If I do not have to push a button to startstop logging the device becomes useable as a remote sensor. Being able to synchronize the clock over the serial interface is a natural extension of that use case, and would allow synchronization through remote control over two or more devices that are not physically close to each other. What are your thoughts Thanks!",,,,,,,,
7299,1575838234,11,"Hi Nicholas, Thanks for writing, and thanks even more for your donation. In answer to your second question, yes. The software is still undergoing final tweaks but it is my understanding that if you plug the device into a USB power source while it is logging it will drop no more than one second of data. For this to work it must be plugged into something other than a computer. If its able to successfully connect to USB within that one second of dropped data then it will stop logging and mount the data card. You would need to plug it into a USB phone charger, or plug it into a computer through a special USB cable that only carries data, but not power. As I mentioned above, plugging it into a PC will cause logging to stop and the card to be mounted. I will speak with Nate about what it would take to implement some realtime monitoring. You are not the first person who has asked about this feature. Thanks, Mike",,,,,,,,

7305,1577481914,17,"Todd Magee No worries we fully understand. Macaw is not going to be for everyone. But to address a few of your points. We like to think of Macaw as a web design tool which in a large way means layout but at the same time it includes styling elements borders, colors, effects, etc, type treatment and more. Typically things that you are manipulated when you are designing, we just are constraining you to what the web has to offer. Also to hit on your Photoshop and Fireworks comment. We are in no way trying to replace something like Photoshop or Fireworks. Those tools are great pieces of software for editing images and creating vector graphics. The part that we are trying to hit is that tools like Photoshop and Fireworks simply dont understand the web and so with Macaw we are trying to create a piece software that truly does. And so with Macaw your workflow will change a little bit. Instead of creating a static image a design that mimics a web layout in Photoshop and then moving to Macaw to recreate the design we think the workflow is a little bit different. Instead you would start your design in Macaw and then as you need specific assets logos, etc you jump into PhotoshopFireworks create your asset, import it into Macaw and continue working in Macaw.",,,,,,,,
7306,1577481914,4,"Hello, can you please explain how can I get my license for the product I thought you would send an email to backers, but I did not get any, so there should be a different way I missed. Thanks Luca",,,,,,,,
7307,1577481914,18,"Im amazed at what has been accomplished so far, that being said Im a little disappointed. Macaw has been toted as a design tool, but I would label it more as a layout tool. The image editing and vector tools needed to design are nonexistent. Therefore, the workflow is to still design in applications like Photoshop and Fireworks, export assetsgraphics, then import and layoutrecreate that design within Macaw. As a designer, Im wondering if I should continue to invest my time in learning Macaw. So my question is Will Macaw eventually evolve into a true designers tool that can replace applications like Photoshop and Fireworks Or will it stay a GUI for coding Again, I think its amazing what youve accomplished so far and is a much need progression in our industry  it just might not be the right tool for me.",,,,,,,,

7425,1605509575,23,"Hello fellow backers. I have some news regarding this project. I had an opportunity to speak with Joshua today. There was a hiccup with the business organization part of the startup. Not a problem with the actual product. He is actively fixing the situation but because it is a contractual issue none of the parties involved can comment publicly. He is not happy about that and it is bothering him that he cannot tell everyone what is happening. I have backed over 50 kickstarters and had great experiences and terrible ones. I have been waiting near a year on a couple and only once did I request and receive a refund. The reason was that after speaking with the principal partner I did not get a sense the project would complete. I feel very good after speaking with Joshua, and I believe that he will be able to complete the delivery of the rewards for this project once the legal details are complete. I have no guarantee, but I am staying the course. There is always a risk in backing a kickstarter, we are just investors so some may fail. This is one where my faith in the project was restored after a conversation. Joshua believes that he will be able to give an update in 4  6 weeks. It is a lot to ask, but I think it will be worth it and you will be part of launching a new company. Yes, it is a lot to trust a stranger on the internet, but what the heck, hope is better than worrying about it. Cheers, Keith",,,,,,,,

So you can control the focus 2 ways, use the left hand thumb wheel single operator or unplug the cable and use the wireless remote dual operator. The follow focus uses stepper motor which gives you a ton of power to turn tight large focus ring in high resolution. The most important part is that its responsive switching from clockwise to counterclockwise without slop at least I dont feel any.

If however hes just giving YEI Technology some kind of loan then it will just postpone trouble. Oh well, its not like YEI Technology are the only ones making full suits.

7643,1645606141,10,"Sean Thompson First of all it was always YEI Technology with whom we were dealing. Secondly Kickstarter is incredibly different from a typical store. Either way, indeed, to get a cc reversal would require you to make false statements e.g. that you bought a product, instead of backed a project, something which at least under a lot of laws is not allowed. The odd thing is how those prohibitions are categorized, which practically means that in general you can not be sued for such a thing directly, but if you do something else wrong it is something that is unlawful. If however you were just arguing about semantics of the word illegal vs unlawful then of course youre technically right, though the difference between those terms is a bit of a mess and I use them interchangeably like many people do. Either way, at best you could wait for YEI Technology to file for bankruptcy and then sue YEI Corportation for mismanagement and hope your claim through Kickstarter holds up. I sincerely have no idea whether it would, but it just might. Oh well, all considered its just a huge mess and if I could I would gladly cancel my order simply because for me the suit is quite worthless if it wont have a big consumer base and without huge reforms I doubt PrioVR will grow a lot.",,,,,,,,

7684,1655426444,97,"Answer for Corey Barberie yes, there is a crossover  more specifically a band pass filter from 30hz to 100hz. The Holster has its own gain control. The Holster gain volume or intensity depends on the gain of the audio source  your music player for example. The easiest way to approach this is to first set the volume on your music player to a comfortable level for your headset. Then turn up the gain control on the Holster until you have enough bass. Does that answer your question",,,,,,,,

All the standard aluminum extrusions can then be bought locally or at least in the same country. The problem for Gigabot however will be that the price then drops to about 500750 US for a kit, because there are not many special parts left. A RAMPS or printrbot driver, some stepper motors rods and couplers, an arduino or equivelent, some threaded rods. Price can be higher when using ballscrews. If bought online from the many sources available it would max out at 500US. Only thing remaining is the instructions to build one. I doubt that is worth 2000US.

7795,1675648229,73,"Carla  Anthony  Thank you so much for your early interest in BSX Insight and your specific questions surrounding the watches you train with. BSX Insight is being built to pair with as many third party watches as possible. To do this, our primary communication pathway is ANT since this has become the de facto standard for transmission of fitness data. Many smart watches including Garmin connect with peripheral devices using this standard however, as of right now, some watches including TomTom, Nike and Pebble currently do not. As mentioned on our project page and in more depth in our FAQ, BSX Insight IS equipped with both ANT and BLE communication stacks. This means that the sensor has the hardware to support any ANT or low energy Bluetooth enabled device, including most sports watches and eventually even phones. That said, theres currently no software in place that would enable Insight to talk directly to devices that do not use ANT. To date, weve tested BSX Insight primarily with Garmin watches  based on the feedback of many of our early beta testers and what devices they train with. Were doing the best we can to ensure that BSX Insight works with as many sports watches as possible when version 1 comes out in late 2014. A lot of this depends on the development cycles of these companys new products and their willingness to work with us to integrate into their ecosystems. For that reason, we cant say with 100 certainty that on Day 1 BSX Insight will work the Nike watch or the TomTom Multisport, but we will update all of our backers as we cross additional sports watches off the list. You can help us by letting your watch manufacturers know that you want your device to pair with BSX Insight and urge them to collaborate with us on making that a reality. We hope that answers your question, but please do not hesitate if you have more andor want further clarification. Thanks again for your support!",,,,,,,,
7796,1675648229,5,"Is easy, only connect your heartbeat band with the garmin as usual, and then before you start the test click connect in the ant device down BSX connect and you see all check it in green. Now i have another problem, im came back to the park and i try to do the test, and when i connect all my device and i finished i stop and when i try to upload the test i have a message LOST CONNECTION, i try to do another test very slow this time and i receive the same message, today is holiday in spain and the gym is close because of than i do the test outdoor. Any ideas, i send you a message with the info, THANKS",,,,,,,,
7797,1675648229,70,"You mentioned swimming in the main page. Do you have any more information how that will work If the Insight sends data to the watch via ANT or Bluetooth and does not log it itself, how will the information be stored as those protocols typically dont work well in water",,,,,,,,
7798,1675648229,23,ryan  httpswww.bsxinsight.comstart,,,,,,,,
7799,1675648229,107,"These are great questions, Alon. Here are our answers 1 How many people were used to create  validate the estimation method for the lactic acid measure Insight uses proprietary machine learning techniques developed from our testing of hundreds of endurance athletes. Our initial sample size of 240 athletes was used to train and test the algorithms. By the time we ship Insight, we anticipate increasing the training set to n600750. 2 Do you have a correlation value or whatever confidence index between the estimation and the measure of lactic acid All of our testing has been to correlate Insights noninvasive measurements with that of traditional blood sampling. At this point our algorithms are slightly more than 95 accurate at identifying LT. With the increased sample sizing and introduction of more sophisticated techniques, our goal is to increase this to 97. As a caveat, traditional blood sampling is taken every 23 minutes. Insight records many times per second. This gives us much greater resolution and theoretically will allow Insight to be more accurate than the old fingerstick method. We believe any discrepancy between the blood and needless method can eventually be explained by the limitations of the old method. These are things were investigating now. 3 Is the exact position of the device on the calf matters that is, if it slides a little along the run, would it through it off Insight is worn on the leg with a compression sleeve that comfortably secures it to your leg during exercise. The compression characteristics of our custom sleeve both prevents movement of the sensor during training and provides calf muscle support to facilitate better circulation. These are important characteristics since placement of Insight over the major muscle belly is important for best measurements. 4 Will the notifications on the watch be calculated on the fly or precalculated on the website Insight was developed to evolve with the athlete as they improve. During training, Lactate Thresholds get better and Insight automatically updates to keep you on pace. Since the timeframe for meaningful lactate improvements is measured in weeks not seconds or minutes the zones will update every 46 weeks. They can be done more frequently if the athlete desires though. Then, each workout the Lactate threshold training zones are pushed to the watch so that real time zone adherence can be calculated on the fly. Athletes are notified immediately any time they drift above or below their target zone so they can stay on pace.",,,,,,,,

A speaker would be very easy to break, would increase product cost, and would very likely sound horrible  tinny and small. Im glad the sound doesnt come from the Moff.

7860,1696003948,8,"Ive done a lot of database work, but almost nothing with FileMaker itself. IIRC, its at least theoretically possible to have FileMaker use some other engine for its datastore, rather than the internal FileMaker database. Im guessing that whether BackerSupport could do that or not depend on if you used FileMakerspecific features of the datastore. I confess, Im fascinated and intrigued by this project, since I did pretty much the same thing. Ive got scripts that log onto Kickstarter and suck down a projects CSV files because I wrote them before Kickstarter offered an option for downloading them all at the same time, and which then restructure the data and load it into PostgreSQL, where I can then track users, send queries, and do other useful things. The UI is handled as a webbased app with Ruby as the substructure, and the shipping labels are courtesy of ReadyShipper, a commercial program for Macs. Ill probably read through the BackerSupport info in more detail tomorrow when I have more time, but Im pretty sure you have a lot of features I dont. Whether I end up switching is a tougher question, because my system grew to also encompass my postKickstarter sales via Etsy. I could share some of my project CSV files with you if you like, but I dont think itd really be that useful, since Kickstarter CSVs are a moving target. ",,,,,,,,

Good luck! ",,,,,,,,
7863,1696003948,9,"Tim Filemaker can create standalone database apps, and starting with the beta, I will be distributing it as a Mac app, a Windows app, and the basic database. During the alpha, it is distributed in database form, which means youll need a copy of FileMaker to play with it but you can get a 30 day trial, and you can get multiple trials. So you dont need to pay anything to play with BackerSupport if you wanted to do some really custom modifications over a longer period youd need to buy FIleMaker. Postage Saver is 60 if you need it cheap for what it does. Regarding currency, right now BS just ignores anything in the Pledge Amount field that isnt a digit or period, so its currencyagnostic. I may have to tweak it to handle currencies where , is the fractions indicator though. As far as I know, KickStarter doesnt mix currencies in their CSV exports if they do, then Ill have to handle that. Validation is just validation you can still ship to an unvalidated address. What validation gets you is the full, properly formatted US address with zip4. I have 1500 US addresses in my database and there are a handful that wont validate, its not a big issue.

And you are so right getting everything ready for release is a monumental task with so much to do I am having some late nights at the moment. The biggest job is getting the code to a state where it can be downloaded and installed safely. Ive been warned to be aware of outofdate distros throwing up issues. Software dependencies is another headache, as Laika requires LIBFTDI, and a few others. And all this needs documenting of course. Then there is manufacturing with PCBs delayed and additional component expense due to having to buy from stockists to make the deadline. There are so many little details to consider too like what packaging to use, antistatic measures, instructions! But youre right it will all be worth it in the end and I cant wait to start seeing the design out there being used. The plan is to let you KS guys get your hands dirty with the Explorer for a while and monitor feedback so I can refine the software and documentation if need be, before the next production run. I will be posting some exciting updates here at the end of the week so stay tuned. And once again, thanks for your patience. Andy",,,,,,,,

As such, your custom shirts will be shipped soon, unlike the mass standardized rewards that have already been shipped to the majority of backers. We have produced and received your custom character cards and tshirt. However, the tshirt first produced for your custom Cat character lacked the visual contrast we desired in terms of aesthetic appeal but more importantly as a visual target for the mobile AR app. As such, we have designed a secondary tshirt for you and are now awaiting to receive it from the production company. You will now receive two 2 custom tshirts once complete, with different designs, but which both feature your favourite colour, purple.

8030,1748573139,1,"Wesley, Users should be able to control bulbs individually. The reason for the problem might be that the Q bulbs are not connected to the Q Station. First, make sure you have updated the latest APP BellQ Pro for iOS, BellQ for Android and firmware. If that does not work, can you try to reset your Q Station  Hold the reset button on the back of the Q Station for around 10s until the right Q Station light turns red.  Last, please match your Q bulbs with the Q Station following the instructions below 1 Turn off the bulb you want to match via power switch, not only in the app. 2 Press the Match button on the back of the Q Station. 3 Turn on the bulb that you want to add via the power switch. 4 Within about 10 seconds, the bulb starts to blink green and will be found in the app. The bulb can only receive the matching signal when it is just turned on in the first 20 secs. So, thats why we need to turn off and on the light bulb.  It should be all set and all Q bulbs should show up on the APP for you to control them individually under light list.

8038,1748753963,48,"Jerome, I cant speak for the creator, but I can speak as a technology support and budget planner. I see this comment made on may products, but you have to look at the whole picture. The Windows phone OS encompasses less than 3 of market share and is falling. If you need to devote time and money to developing a solid product, hiring a developer to cover 3 or less of your market is not fiscally responsible. Even a part time developer for a third OS could easily eat 20K40K of their budget. If they can spend less and hit 96.3 of all users, that is more responsible. Taking 3 of the current backings, you would only have about 7.5K before accounting for hardware costs. Now if you were willing to personally fund a developer, Im sure they would have no issues. If you take 3 of the 2000 backers, you would get 60 potential Windows phone users. If you were to give each one a 50 android tablet, it would still be cheaper  6,250 than developing for the Windows Phone OS to be supported. Im guessing many of those 60 have a iOS or Android device already available to them.

8077,1761268469,3,"Hey, Just forked the latest source and got it working, everything seems very nice and smooth. I try not to comment on anything functionality related as its a very alpha stage  but Id like to ask something that came to me from a comment made around albums. I understand that people like to categorize photos differently.  You Jaisen and others by tags.  Other users by albums that they manage manually.  I like my pics automatically added to albums by their date taken and these albums named according to the date and gps location.  Random dude might want to have instant albums based on tags, date and person on photo. By no means I expect that everyones crazy idea should be even considered  but  what if we could allow users to help each other  Plugins... Photo viewer plugins for example.  Tags  Albums  Datetime  Some random EXIF or meta tag.  All of the above Photo uploader plugins.  Automatically organize uploaded pic according to something  Reverse GPS location and add street name to description  Face recognition  Automatically cropresizeaddyellowdotstoimage... Anything goes. The reason why Im suggesting such an approach is that people WILL hack the source I have already started to add functionality they want for themselves. Why not allow them to do it in a orderly fashion and help other nondevelopers to benefit from it Thanks for a great app and sorry for ranting. xD George aka geoah.",,,,,,,,

As a music lover and an audio enthusiasts getting to learn how to design my own amplifier was one of my favorite achievements during my undergraduate studies. Whats great is that Dr. Wierzba has mastered this material for decades and getting to learn some of his tricks made things so much simpler and effective. Like I said I cant back this project enough.

8241,1794519921,15,"Wayne, thanks for your great question. We made an early design decision to use a leading edge triac for simplicity and cost savings. This is a design decision I have revisited quite a bit and in hind sight I wish I would have gone with a trailing edge solution right away even with the additional cost. With that said, I do trigger the triac with long sustained pulses meaning that the Luminode does work quite well with most newer dimmable compact florescents and dimmable LED bulbs. Down the road I would like to produce a version that does trailing edge or even something more sophisticated to not only work with inductive loads but get better performance out of dimmable florescents and LEDs probably using an IGBT. But I want to do more research on it first.",,,,,,,,

The wireless protocols are different, however they can coexist and be integrated by connecting the Luminode dongle to the same machine that talks to the other switches. We already have developed Insteon drivers to translate their protocol to XML so that their devices work with our leaning software.

Regarding the video demo Youve explained how getting off the couch is sensed. What does the back end system need to know about the DVRDVDOther and how does it know it Is the Luminode system reading the IR signal from the pause button to know that the video has been paused A frequent scenario at my house is that well pause a DVD using the remote and go to the kitchen for a drink refill and maybe to the bathroom. I would want the actions of pausing the DVD and getting up from the couch to turn on a light in the kitchen and bathroom and then turn those off after we sit down on the couch and hit play on the remote.

8267,1799423471,33,"Nick, I started to write asking you to clarify what you were talking about but then I got it. I like that idea of the air tube. To build on that, we could attache the air vent to the tube so that its always at the bottom of the bottle.

I highly encourage all backers to join the community over at PartyRobotics.com so that once this Kickstarter project winds down we can continue the discussion on that forum. Personally, I want the smart guys at PartyRobotics to enhance the pump electronics and stuff that is more complicated while the community works on enhancements that are more accessible and can be shared. Im currently designing a case for the B15 that I think is pretty kick ass. It has a 24 by 16 footprint and all of the pumps face forward. Its made of stainless steel and bent acrylic.

I think what is most appropriate is for this company to respond to its backers and clear the air. When something stinks of a fraud, more than likely it is, particularly when no response or when responses are vague. It would not be the first time that this has happened but to continue to fan ignorance and just tell the backers here to accept their loss is not an acceptable solution. There is no doubt that you have risks as an investor, and if Kickstarter has now become an investment vehicle with risk, I would suggest they need to be regulated like any other investment vehicle with due diligence to ensure no deceit and under the eyes of the law.

That is definitely what youre looking for. As are we. In the meantime, I suppose we could give you an update on some of the less exciting things. The mount for the chain is pretty awesome and you havent seen it yet. The packaging also looks fantastic. The chain is complete. The Oring tooling is complete. How about I get some good photos of all those parts and send out an update in the next week and then send another update with photos from the tooled samples",,,,,,,,
8293,1812220599,708,"Kirpa, thanks so much for your generous support. I think the questions are great. Your point is exactly why we need the app to at least periodically get permission from our servers. That way, they will lose permission once the app reaches out to our servers and is denied. In a perfect world where there is always data, we would make them do it every single time they attempt to open Kevo. In an imperfect world, we could require this at set intervals. If they shut off data, once the prescribed interval ran out and they couldnt get permission, theyd be refused. Thanks",,,,,,,,

8298,1812715552,5,"What a game changer. Great idea. These should also displace scooters as a healthier choice, just provision it to secure a quality strapped bag, for runs to the local store where permitted",,,,,,,,
8299,1812715552,7,Dennis That is a great question. We designed the remote electronics to be used in fleet operations. We chose to use bluetooth technology to connect the remote to the GolfBoard because it uses adaptive frequency hopping AFH designed to eliminate interference between remotes sharing the 2.4 GHz spectrum. This adaptive hopping among 79 frequencies at 1 MHz intervals gives a high degree of interference immunity and also allows for more efficient transmission within the spectrum The short answer is No. You WILL NEVER have a problem with interference from other GolfBoard riders.

I didnt like using my air gap flash as it was very loud and they are very temperamental and unpredictable, you never knew when the flash tube would explode. After seeing your video I also like the fact the vela one is silent. 3the portability, one thing I wish I could do with the air gap flash.

8328,1822467064,18,I am looking forward to trying this out. One not at all important question. Do the LED modules that you are using come with the reflector integrated into the LED itself The reason that I am asking is because I am wondering if clustering all nine LEDs in a smaller area might make it easier to use one larger reflector to get a smaller but brighter spot. The emitting area looks to be about 2.5cm circular. Nine LEDs look like they might be able to fit into a 12 cm square its hard to tell from just an outside look which would make for a reasonable reflector to collect and shape the light.

Griddle sits on the structure and no bed leveling or auto calibration occurs. 2 This will vary with viscosityspeed and pressure but typically it is about 23mm. I typically calibrate it at the onset by drawing a few test lines and go from there. 3 USB port will be provided for firmware updates.  4 It is sort of a WYSIWYG interface when you hand draw it. The width of the line is represented by the width of the pencil tool on the computer. We are still developing the software and the version we use currently allows you to see the path of head on the griddle. We could most likely add a width and color distinction to that software to enhance what you will see. We will add that as a possibility to the software in future updates,,,,,,,,

8397,1843421663,98,"A DAC isnt supposed to alter the original sound just reproduce the analogue sound that was recorded and digitized converted from analogue to digital thus compressed. A good DAC should maintain the natural sound through the chain, for the sake of what we call HiFi. What the Leo amplifier recreates is that typical vintage sound most of us like so much because of that smooth and warm sound and amplifies the sound modern devices usually do not have a capable amp section built in to keep them cost effective. Does the filter change the original sound It does as it is intended to do and that wont do justice to the natural sound. Does that make it bad No, personally on the contrary its a matter of preference and its likely to make the music sound more pleasant to listen to. Certain people prefer bass heavy headphones, some like the vintage sound nothing wrong with that. So imo the output of a good DAC should NOT have any effect on the sound whereas the LEO is intended to do just the opposite for positive reasons.",,,,,,,,

8419,1845693471,165,"Hi CK! There are 3 different answers to that question 1. All the boards that can control more than 3 or 4 servos require external power for the servos. This is of course a possible configuration with the DuinoBot. When used that way, its equivalent to an Arduino Uno or an Arduino Leonardo 14 digital IOs  6 digital IOs in the analog input pins. There, you can connect one servo per pin. 6 of these pins also control the integrated HBridge for the DC motors, which is a feature not present in the standard Arduinos. 2. But if you want more servos, you can add any standard servo shield they costs about 12 to 20, and you can extend the number a lot. There are different techniques implemented in different standard servo shields. 3. If you want to use the interna boosted power supply, you will be able to control about 3 servos directly, depending on the other things connected to the DuinoBot DC Motors, sensors. This is the typical configuration of a differential traction robot 2 motors with a small gripper, or with a pantilt ultrasonic ranger or a camera. The idea behind the DuinoBot is to let the user to easily build a robot like that, with very powerful metal geared motors, plus some servos and all the sensors. And when a big quantity of servos is needed, the standard shields can be added. Take into account that the power supply in the DuinoBot is probably the stat of the art in Arduinocompatible boards It tooks only 3AA rechargable batteries 3.6 V and brings 12V to the DC Motors and 5 V to servos and standard servos with good current and good autonomy, thanks to its nearly 94 of effiency much more than a standard Arduinocompatible board.

I was able to find most of the papers just by doing an internet search, with the exception of Brain responses for the subconscious recognition of faces. This gets into some very interesting territory when you ask how much information you can get from EEG generated data. It doesnt seem so far fatched to believe that EEG could facilitate detection of novelty vs. familiarity, but thus far I dont think this has been provenaccepted. Also, this a gateway into a lot of brain fingerprinting and polygraph controversies. I also dont know how things change when you are able to collect and analyze huge quantities of EEG data, as opposed to just a much smaller quantitydemographic in a lab setting. Here are a few interesting and maybe relevant papers  httpwww.plosone.orgarticleinfo3Adoi2F10.13712Fjournal.pone.0054258 httpknightlab.berkeley.edustaticspublications20101216CompleteDoc.pdf.pdf httpbme2.aut.ac.irmhmoradiEN.Journal20ArticlesA20new20approach20for20EEG20feature20extraction20in20P300based20lie20detection.pdf I am not necessarily supporting the conclusions in these papers, but if these groups are looking to such matters maybe its worth trying to establish a group to peer review the programs created for EEG Im not very familiar with the open source community, though, so maybe thats a stupid idea.

8533,1868708892,85,"Stephen, Sorry I misunderstood the question. Without getting too far into it here, we can see from careful reading of the article, particularly part III, you can see that at f2 which Veydra lenses are at T2.2 or f2 of you prefer there is little onaxis issues and MTF can only be decreased slightly offaxis. We tested Veydra Mini Prime lenses on both the BMPCC, BMCC 2.5K MTF, and the GH4 before releasing them. While the sensor stack thickness varies on these cameras, given the relatively high T number compared to the f numbers spoken of in this article via an optical adapter, we can say that any issues in MTF would be insignificant. Veydra Mini Primes are nearly telecentric design for digital further negating any sensor stack issues. Also the high MTF of the Veydra Mini Primes makes any issues that sensor stack would provide a nonissue because a 4K sensor couldnt resolve them. In short, you are correct, at T2.2 it really doesnt matter and the high MTF of Veydra Mini Primes makes it really not matter as it wouldnt be resolved by even a 4K sensor. If anything, these articles can make the case for purpose built optics rather than adapters! Thanks, Ryan",,,,,,,,

8605,1887510602,11,"Hi Brian, We designed the survey to give us an idea of the mix of legacy hardware, and hardware configurations we will be working with. The answers from the survey will drive some of what goes into our box, to work with that mix. For example, specifying the cord length which works for most backers with an extra long accessory cord on hand for the outliers. Driving the decisions on valve clamping hardware which fits the ball valves. Either multiple clamp sizes in the box, or specific clamp sizes in the box which match your specific valve size. Some of the questions are simply calibration questions, for example of less popular meter makes and models. In fact, well be reaching out again for more details on specific legacy hardware situations so that we can maximize our utility with the fewest accessories, or special cases. Thanks Alex",,,,,,,,

Our unit is designed for indoor usage and the moisture that is typical in most basements will not present a problem. Thanks again for your support.f",,,,,,,,
8607,1887510602,46,"David Z, Utility Owned I believe this would be a question you would have to ask the utility to get a solid answer. Power It goes without saying supplying power to something that is placed outside falls on the home owner. The onus falls on the home owner to follow all the regulations  safety rules that apply to them in their State  Province. This would fall under the electrical NEC  CEC for outdoor permanent installation of a electrical box which would require a local GFCI or a GFCI breaker on the main panel that services that circuit. An extension cord is not allowed and is intended for temporary use. You would also need to consider your home owner insurance. Outdoor Rated As far as I am aware the creator has not indicated their device being outdoor rated to sustain extreme hot  cold. If the device is being considered for such a role temperature rated parts would need to be used. The PCB would need to be sprayed with a moisture barrier, the housing would need to be UV rated and temp tolerant. Its safe to say any outdoor device would need serious testing and indicate a safe working operating range. Battery I would hope the design would be capable of monitoring the battery level. Since this is going to be connected to the cloud. It would be great to incorporate a battery status monitor showing the install date, percentage of power left, and allow a warning message to be sent to the user. It goes without saying all of this should be available via a local API so the same data could be pushed  polled to the end user.",,,,,,,,
8608,1887510602,47,I believe your last comment was removed by KS because it was seen as self promoting another KS project that was unsolicited. I am just guessing here.

8640,1898826389,56,"Emmanuel.. I cant speak for the whole Arduino team but I have spoken to some of them.. One of the main developers is in my research group at MIT and we actually spoke about this yesterday.. He said he didnt have a problem with our web based software not being released as open source and is excited about Modkits ability to bring Arduino development to a wider, less technical audience.. I think it is each developers right to decide which licenses are appropriate for each of thier projects and find it useful to weigh the benefits to users, developers, and the larger community on a case by case basis.. That being said, our custom Arduino based IDE is released as GPL, and the custom Modkit libraries as LGPL which means users are not locked in to our environment.. Our soontobe released robotics platform developed with Sparkfun will also be open source and our Crimp Card line and documentation are distributed under a creative commons license.. Were happy to talk about our reasoning for each of these decisions and take suggestions that would actually help end users and the larger community..

We are now one year further and I and 88 backers 50 or more or still waiting on the desktop version of Modkit. I really regret this, because I couldnt wait to use Modkit in my classroom. I think its great to use the Scratch programming style for standalone products. However almost nothing changed over the year, their is some progress but most things stay like variables in the Alpha club, for which you have to pay. Still essential things are missing to do some real programs. The Google group is silent, the blog doesnt show progress and a full free version on the site is promised for the summer but we are in autumn already. I hope they will start something more open, because they are building on the shoulder of open source giants Scratch and Arduino. It is a pitty that the lack of progress and communication makes me lose faith in the Kickstarter concept a bit as well. Its based on trust and a get the feeling this trust is now violated. Well, I hope well see a reaction of the developers here. Im still waiting on concept like this to use in my classes.

8727,1912716008,56,"Hi Joseph. Thanks for your question. The phone components are encased in a hard black plastic box that weve stressed tested under rainforest conditions. That said, there is always more testing to do  and different places have different challenges. We expect every deployment will integrate new lessons learned, including any challenges with animal life. Heres why we think it is unlikely that loggers will destroy the devices, per your question Can illegal loggers find the devices in the trees When installed in the field, the devices are nearly invisible in the tree canopy. The photos of the device that are shown on this Kickstarter page lowmounted on trees are solely for display purposes, because you cant show a hidden device. If a device is properly placed high in the canopy, its nearly impossible to seemade even more undetectable by the 23 square kilometer range many many thousands of trees which are covered by a single device. Different rainforests have different attributes, but in Indonesia we could barely find the devices after we put them up ourselves. Beyond that, the devices do have a theftdetection routine. In any instance where a device is moved after being installed, local authorities receive an alert. We therefore believe that the favorable circumstances wellhidden, and large range combined with our proactive design efforts antitheft routine will continue to prevent anyone from tampering with the devices.",,,,,,,,

Can I ask one thing do you have any idea at all very roughly when the bluetooth switch will be developed The light is being put in as part of a renovation and ideally I wish to ceiling mount it but if the switch is a long time away this may not be an option and I dont just want the option of the app to switch the light on. This may be covered in your comments but is the app able to come on automatically daily to map the sun or do you each morning have to turn it on. Is it possible for it not to come on at weekends or specified days, this would be really handy if possible as a switch is less of an issue then and the renovation which is an office wouldnt tend to be used at the weekends so Im guessing if a schedule facility like my edimax wifi plugs is built in this would really make switching on and off for many people something they dont even have to consider.

8810,1933620264,41,Thank Chris. 1 Can you elaborate more on how the microphones work. Are you saying that I need a Kinect in order for the hub to be able to hear me What does the Kinect do that a standard mic couldnt Does the hub use the video from the Kinect as well Will I need multiple Hubs if I have a large house and multiple floors 2 I currently use ZWave devices and have a HomeSeer ZTroller as my primary controller. Will I need to buy additional items for the Hub to communicate with my existing setup,,,,,,,,
8811,1933620264,12,"creator, Phil Hawthorne, I have been doing a bit of researching on this hub. There is not much literature that really explains exactly what it is and the distinction between the HUB vs OS is very unclear. Perhaps taking a cue from other larger companies would be in order. Stop branding the CastleOS for the CastleHUB and just use the word app. If the OS is a totally independent home automation solution, it should be marketed as such. Just because the HUB uses the OS to manage the operation, novices such as myself get confused quite easily and any added frustration is a huge turnoff. Just be up front and clear with what the CastleHUB will provide and what additional equipment we will need to purchase. Besides the Hub, we will need 1 to 2 Kinects to make the voice feature work. Is Kinect the only option or can we use Sonos Also, please clariy the USB adaptorsradio frequency conversation you had on March 22. Am I to understand that in addition to the Hub and the Kinect, we must also purchase adaptors for each type of freq we intent to use Or will this do as the website suggests and ship with fully integrated support for more smart devices than any other home automation controller. I am quite confused on this point. If I have a zwave, zigbee, UPB, Sonos, oor any other such device already in my home will I need buy adaptors for each one of these frequencies or will I be able to pair the devices with the hub out of the box",,,,,,,,

In fact my wife and I just bought our first home and we are eager to hear what she has to say! For the past few weeks I have been comparing several hubs and until today, SmartThings was on top. Once I saw the possibilities of CastleOS I immediately became a backer. There are still some technical issues I am trying to sort out such as what is the difference between the CastleHUB and CastleOS but I will do some more searching around and find those answers or check back here. But, what Id like to know is will the CastleHUB support SmartThings devices and has there been any progress with Zigbee support Thanks!",,,,,,,,

8886,1952545872,15,"Hi Kevin, Thanks for the feedback. The Tees, Spring Heads, and Clamps are 7.5mm x 7.5mm x length. The OpenBeam is 15mm wide and we chose to design the Tees, Spring Heads, and Clamp to be half the width of the OpenBeam. The thumb screws with a 7mm head diameter were designed so that the head of the screw would not protrude beyond the 7.5mm dimension of the parts. This would allow a rod to travel over the head of the thumb screw without interference. It would also allow two Spring Heads to be placed directly next to each other, without the heads of the thumb screws interfering with one another. As an aside, that is why the thumb nuts have a 7mm diameter too. If you can not get enough torque with the 7mm headed thumb screw, here are two options i use a M3x0.5x7mm pan head screw and tighten with the hex driver or ii try using one of the 14mm headed thumb screws. Hopefully that will allow you to get sufficient torque. Based on the testing we have done, the aluminum has been able to withstand the torque sufficient to hold the 3mm rod. When we began this project, we issued two requests for quotes RFQ for the parts i one for aluminum and ii one for stainless steel. We received a lot of responses to our RFQs. Because of the material cost and the added cost of machining stainless it takes longer than aluminum to machine, the cost of the stainless RFQ was substantially more than the aluminum, to a point where the extra cost of stainless, in our opinion, was not justifiable.",,,,,,,,

So an amateur electrician can fiddle with that and make it happen.

Sending signals would require some extra development work, which some talented folks might be interested in looking into. The tracking range depends on many factors lens selection, IR LED power,  of LEDs. Our Tracking Pod has a max range of about 3060 feet in most sunlight conditions. The range could be much farther in lowlight conditions, or it could be on the short end of that range if there are many potential interferences and bright sunlight. Thomas",,,,,,,,

I like this kindof discussion! If IRLOCK was incorporated into a brushless gimbal setup, it would not be used for stabilization. The gimbal would still have full control over camera stabilization. IRLOCK would act like a receiver input like when you manually control the pitch.yaw of your gimbal ... Let me know if am not making any sense.

Ive been coating the secondary in polyurethane 2 coats per day since, I am up to about 7 coats now and it is quite thick. Reading the forums I noted that people were often putting on more coats, so I will keep coating for as long as I can wait.. When testing my main board I cant hear the GDT buzzing like it says in the manual. As I havent tried the full setup yet, but will in a few days. The main thing that I have noted is that the mounting of the IGBT is not very accurate. I found that I had to bend them in a very different position far closer to the body of the T220 package causing one leg to break. Lucky I purchased the spares pack.

Thanks for your comment and sharing your thoughts  we really like it! yup, adding wifi which allows the Phoenard to be involved in the Internet of Things phenomenon is something that we have thought since the veryvery beginning. However, initially we were aiming to allow the user to add wifi functionality as an onboard addonsextensions. Since we think there are many kind of Wifi module and platform out there and people might prefer one than another. So those who need it can customize it themselves. Until several weeks back we found a Wifi module ESP8266 esp03 which is not only lowcost and popular, but more importantly, the module fits perfectly to our current design. So yeah, following the 100 goal, why not we use it as the extended goal.  And dont forget to keep telling people about the Phoenard!",,,,,,,,

8955,1969678009,53,"Mark, I cant speak for Louis, but the kind of board designed for the Bee rarely sources the kind of current needed for a solenoid. The microcontroller can usually put out 4050 mA at 3.3V, but depending on the solenoid youve got, youll need a few amps at 24V! It also depends on how long you need it activated  you might be able to limit the battery draw by using some larger capacitors. Usually, this sort of problem is solved by switching a larger current with a transistor controlled by the microcontroller. Further, youll need to ensure that the battery is capable of sourcing the current required by your solenoid  since that could be 110A or more, its hard to say whether his standard batteries will work. In short, there should be no problem doing what you want, but youll likely need at least a small connected board with a transistor and some filtering capacitors, and 24V stepup regulator directly connected to the battery either Louis standard battery or a larger upgraded battery.",,,,,,,,

8960,1970245260,11,"Rover Simulator by Asteroid Mining Corporation Jan 23 2015 Kickstarter update I have been working on the Rover Simulator webpage. it is under construction LIVE so please excuse the messy 1990s look haha. so, i want to change the main front page to say view or drive which will be free to view or, at this time, 0.01 per minute to drive. After the user clicks view, they will be able to view through the rovers eyes, and also i will be adding other cameras in the room. so you can choose between first person rovers eye view and 3rd person like in online games, where you can see the entire area with the rover driving around. i have the paypal shopping cart working, so it sends the person to the drive page after successful payment. if they cancel the payment, it will go back to the main page, or the view page. i also have the timer working, so that after the number of seconds, it will automatically send the person to the main view only page. I did have an on screen timer you could watch, but each time i hit the onoff headlight button, it would reset the on screen timer. so i can just take that off temporarily. but at least the main timer embedded in the page still works. we will have to debug this problem in the coming weeks. i will be connecting the raspberry to the rc vehicle soon. i have to connect speed controllers to these dc motors because after testing this rc car, they go VERY VERY FAST. there is NO WAY i can let people drive it at this speed. my programmer may be able to program the speed control in the script so i may not have to put the actual speed controller hardware. This would make it more light weight and i can adjust the speed remotely also as an admin. i have to mount the raspberry pi b to the motor controller in the next few weeks, so that the power for the motors come from a separate battery bank. im looking into putting a voltage step down regulator on this rc vehicle, so that i can have 1 main large 12volt battery bank, and then jump off with the step down transformer to provide up to 2 amps 5 volts for the raspberry pi to run. This will also help when i put sensors on this rover, and link it to the control panel on the website, so people can keep an eye on their power levels. it will also keep the raspberry at the correct voltage longer. Please follow this project on Twitter RoverSimulator and check out the Rover Simulator Facebook page at httpswww.facebook.compagesRoverSimulatorbyAsteroidMiningCorporation275728195965290 You may see the Rover Simulation studio under construction until at least March 1, 2015 here httpwww.RoverSimulator.com Some people do not reveal the sites until they are working but i like to let people see the progress as it gets worked on. I mainly work on it each weekend due to my work schedule, but try to do some during the week if possible. please like our main Facebook company page at httpwww.AsteroidMiningCorp.com and follow us on twitter there too MineAsteroids Thanks!

8961,1970245260,14,We are working on the Raspberry Pi Bs scripts and things. Everything is running smooth. Hopefully i will have some things to show you very soon. TJ,,,,,,,,
8962,1970245260,9,"Here is an update on the Rover Project. I still anticipate March 1, 2015 is when we can drive it remotely. Please be patient if we are not unable to hit that goal, but we are trying very hard! We are still working on the programming of the motors, to work with the webpage and the Raspberry Pi B. I have purchased a few more things i have already spent way more than the 58 we received on this Kickstarter project, since this is an ongoing project. We actually had a 5 donation reversed due to an expired credit card from one of our backers, so we will only receive 53 minus fees, so im thinking it was about 4748. So i figured, since i will be upgrading this to a larger unit soon and need more supplies while my programmer is working, i went ahead and purchased a few extra parts. Here are those parts part 1 i ordered a 12 volt to 5 volt step down module. Should get it between Feb 10 and Feb 14, 2015. This will allow me to have a larger battery for the rover for more capacity and power, and then using this module, i can also convert some of that down to 5 volt, to power the Raspberry Pi B. I can input anywhere from 6 to 24 volts, and step it down to 5 volts for the smaller electronics, leds, etc. This module has 2 screw terminals that come directly from a battery and the other side is a usb port, perfect for connecting my Raspberry Pi with 1 simple cord. Part 2 is similar, and was ordered first from China but this part is better, and i ordered from USA, so should get it next week. Input voltage 624V Output voltage 5V0.2V OUtput current 3A Peak output 4A Installation hole 14 x 35mm Switch frequency 385k httpwww.ebay.comitm161349214391  part 2 I had ordered another part actually ordered this one first and it is similar to part 1. This step down voltage converter has slightly different stats, and shaped different. Here are the specs Input DC 820V, 12V changes to 5V 6. Output DC 5V, 3A, 15W. 7. Size 46mm X 27mm X 14mm httpwww.ebay.comitm141465460302  part 3 I ordered and already received 2 of these small motor drivers. Some Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects i seen online use this in a breadboard to control motors, so i bought it thinking i could try it out too. It was only 0.99 each. httpwww.ebay.comitm390721914624  part 4 i bought, and already received this Raspberry Pi B night vision camera. It is very very small, lightweight and will be used for the new on board camera. The original ip camera in this Kickstarter will now be the wide view or 3rd person view in the room, so you can see the rover drive around with that. If i can streamline it properly, i may even give you up to 270 degrees of motion on the bigger ip camera, but it will have to be opened in a totally separate window. To put both of these in the same webpage, the ip camera will not be controllable at this time. httpwww.ebay.comitm331439560143  part 5 i bought 3 laser pointers. im going to try and hotwire them and let you control it onoff from the webpage, just as you will be able to turn the headlights onoff. This will simulate the burning laser that is currently on the real Mars rovers. It can also be used as a pointing device, if the person driving would like to point to something, so that the other people watching him drive live can see what he is talking about.  part 6 i also bought an led flashlight, it has onoffstrobe. I will possible use this for the new headlight. Possible future updates... I may be installing a digital microscope to the rover, and allowing the live video to show on the webpage. This will simulate rover science experiments. I may also install a drill on the rover, so you can simulate drilling holes into the ground. If it is inside a building, then i may not include the drill bit at this time. I may be adding MANY sensors in the next few months, please watch for updates. I may be hiring someone to help me make the main control panel template, with all of the buttons and things. im wanting a cool looking design for a webpage and phone app. contact me to help with this. Another thing, I may let the person driving the robot communicate via audio with the rest of the people in the chat room, this is just a possibility in the future. Im thinking of using Skype audio, or Teamspeak, or Ventrillo. Im also thinking of expanding the rover simulator business and duplicating a lot of it, to make more telepresence robots, once we get this main rover working. We can easily use it as a template. If you can think of cool ideas to use this for, let me know. We are considering it for remote security applications, doctor visits remotely, telepresence sight seeing and more.

8963,1970245260,7,"Kickstarter update Feb 15, 2015 Rover Simulator Project tested ip camera Happy Valentines day everyone! Today i had a chance to test the ip camera that you all helped me purchase for the Rover Simulator Project. Since it is too large to put on the first Rover, i will use it as a 3rd person view camera. This will allow you to watch the rover from a birds eye view and may be easier to avoid obstacles. I tested this camera next to my desktop, hard wired to the modem using an Ethernet cable. It worked flawlessly! Then, i followed the instructions to activate the wireless feature. It also worked flawlessly! I took it in another room, which is through 2 cinder block walls, and it was still able to receive the wifi and worked perfectly. So, at this time, it gave me a local ip address, i then logged directly into my routers settings and created a virtual server and port forwarded a certain port, directly to this ip camera. This allows me to access the ip camera remotely over the internet. I then used one of my spare domain names, and forwarded traffic from this domain name, to my external ip address which is automatically forwarded to my local ip address to the ip camera. i then chose the masking option in the domain forwarding options, to hide my personal external ip address. I have two ways of showing the ip cameras video, either by using the software called Yawcam, in which it is just the video and you can not control the ip camera to move updownleftright or the 2nd way to see the video, is login directly to the ip camera, into its builtin webserver, to see the ip cameras web page that gives the option to turn the camera left and right 270320 degrees, and you can also tilt it up and down. This is nice but i have a problem incorporating this video WITH CONTROLS into the website of the Rover Simulator. It will be a lot easier to just have it as 1 still video stream, but i hope i can allow you to have complete control over it in the future. It is made mainly as a security camera, so therefore to get all of the controls, it want you to login with a username and password as an admin. I can not allow this, since some people would change important settings. So, for now, we will just have it as a streaming 2nd video source in the 3rd person view. I hope to put this live on the official www.RoverSimulator.com page soon. Since the studio is not finished yet, i have a few options. 1. i can put the camera in a box, and you can log in anytime you want, and you can only see the inside of the box boring since it has night vision infrared leds. We will use our imagination, as if it is in a cargo box, in the cargo hold of a spaceship, on the way to Mars. 2. later, when i get more things done with this project, i can take it out of the box, and then i may put it in a small room, and we will consider it in the cargo hold of the spaceship. You will only be able to control the camera, and not drive the rover in this area. 3. we will upgrade it so that you can control the camera, and drive the rover in this cargo hold area. 4. we will use our imagination again, since this is the Rover Simulator and we will let the rover be controlled in our cafeteria. We have another project going on with a cafeteria and meeting space, attached to our warehouse. So, since we have this space, we may let it be used as the mess hall or cafeteria for the space ship role playing that we are doing, until we get to Mars. 5. Once the first part of the simulation studio is done, we will consider it Mars, or a moon of mars, or the Moon, or another planet, etc. THEN we will try to let people drive it, on this simulated surface. I may put it in a 25ft.x25ft. room at first, 6. then upgrade to a longer 10ft.x50ft. hallway, 7.and then maybe into a gymnasium. 8.I do not think we will put it outdoors at this time, but hopefully a future version can be outdoors. It would be nice to have a dslr cameratelescope added so you can literally look up at the stars and see them in real life, but we are limited to the webcam, internet speed, and possible light pollution in the area.

8964,1970245260,6,"Kickstarter update Feb. 21, 2015 Rover Simulator Project part needed ip cam... Here is a quick update to our successful Kickstarter Rover Simulator Project part needed ip cam You will be able to login to our official control panel, located on our website at httpwww.RoverSimulator.com please read this entire update before you do! We will have different phases of completion. we are on 1 1. Basic website working, with live chat working, live webcam, free for everyone to view. Camera will automatically turn off after 5 minutes if you want to continue watching, simply refresh the browser. Since this is a rover simulation project then you will have to use your imagination and roleplay a little. Here is where we are with the project Our first rover is named Pekka. Pekka is in a cargo box, inside the cargo hold of a spaceship. The view from the live camera is from inside this cargo box, looking out from the rovers eyes. It is on a spaceship that is on its way to the planet Mars, or a Mars moon. At this time, there is no sound and you cannot control the rovers camera or control the rover in anyway since it is strapped in during launch and space travel. Everyone has full access right now, to view inside this cargo box, no password needed. 2. Once the spaceships crew has things ready, they will take the rover out of the cargo box and put it in the cargo hold which is basically the holding area, storage area, or warehouse area of the spaceship. You may see other items also in the cargo hold for use on the ship, Mars, Mars moons, habitats, etc. You will not be able to control the cameras view updownleftright and you will not be able to drive the rover at this time. 3. Once the spaceships crew has all of their basic chores and tasks done, then they will set the rover up for testing. This is when you start getting a chance to control features on the rover. At first, they will activate the ability to turn on the running lights, headlights, spot lights, laser burnerpointer etc. This is where you come in, we need your help for testing, so feel free to turn the lights onoff when we are at this point, and comment on our Facebook page at httpswww.facebook.compagesRoverSimulatorbyAsteroidMiningCorporation275728195965290 You will not have control over the cameras view updownleftright or drive the rover, yet. Everyone, even if they supported this Kickstarter project or not, will have full access of helping test out the rovers lights on the official Rover Simulator Studio Projects web page control panel. 4. When the spaceship crew gets time to check the main components of the rover, to make sure the controls are working, then they will put the rover in a spaceship corridor hallway and activate the motors, so if you have supported this Kickstarter, or if you decide to buy drive time then you will be able to drive this rover in the hallway of the spaceship. This will also be used for testing purposes and if you find any bugs, or if the spaceship crew notices anything, they may, with or without warning place the rover in a safe standby mode. If this happens, it will not be driveable until the issue has been corrected. It may be possible that 2 people may login to control the rover at the same time, so we will have to schedule your drive time that you paid for if this becomes an issue. It is a possibility, that 2 or more people may be able to control the rover at the same time. This will be irritating and could possibly damage the rover, so this is a possible bug we will need to work out. Be patient with us. we are looking into bringing more rovers to life in the coming months, so like our Facebook page to stay involved in that! That will keep you from fighting over driving our rover. 5. Once the rover has been successfully tested in the spaceships corridor, then hopefully we will have landed on Mars or a Mars moon. This will be when our actual simulator studio has been completed, with special effects on the walls, floors, ceilings. Please be patient as this is the most expensive portion of the project. This is one reason you will be driving in the spaceship at first, so that you get a chance to drive the rover like we promised, at the same time we have realism in our Rover Simulator Project. If you want to invest in our Rover Simulator Project, such as helping us with funds so we can build multiple rovers for multiple drivers, or adding sensors, or upgrading to more realistic looking rovers, with added features such as telescopingzooming robotic arms, cameras, probes, drills, etc. or to improve our simulator studios effects and moonplanet surface, or create other Rover Simulator studios around the world, then email TJ McKinney at AsteroidMiningRocketMail.com with the subject line Rover Simulator.

Regarding the battery, Carbon uses a lithiumion battery and the battery life is expressed in charge cycles. The average is approximately 500 charge cycles which is what you can expect.

9045,1986408821,28,"Hi Denny, So whats the difference between PCR and qPCR They do essentially the same job make copies of DNA. They both can take a tiny amount of DNA and amplify it, making millions or billions of copies in 1 hour. So both PCR and qPCR machines can help detect or manipulate any specific piece of DNA, using the same technology and underlying chemistry. The difference lies in the way you look at the output DNA. When using miniPCR or any other PCR machine, you directly visualize the millions of copies of DNA youve made. For this you use a technique called DNA electrophoresis, where you separate the DNA made by PCR on a gel and make it shine with a fluorescent label all this is included in the DNA Discovery System. You get to actually see the DNA with your own eyes, and interpret it. With traditional PCR you more directly see the DNAs size and how many different versions of that DNA you had for example, if youre looking at the two copies of a gene that you inherited from your father and mother.  With quantitative or realtime PCR, theres an optical reader built into the machine that can tell you if you have made copies of DNA or not. The process is contained within the PCR machine and does not involve the user. It gives you a more sensitive read of the amount of DNA made, but it can be a bit more complex to characterize the DNA this involves the use of melting curves based on thermodynamic parameters. WHEN TO USE EACH In my work as a molecular biologist... ...I will use qPCR when I care to know EXACTLY how much DNA or RNA you have in a sample e.g. does cell A express more of a given gene than cell B ...And I would mostly use PCR like miniPCR if I want WHETHER A GENE IS THERE OR NOT, or to prepare a gene for sequencing. Another major difference is cost. Quantitative PCR machines and reagents are several times more expensive than PCR machines and reagents. To your other question, a single package of our miniPCR DNA testing kits will contain enough reagents for 30 to 50 PCR runs. You can see a preview of our labs, and learn more about PCR, here httpwww.minipcr.compcrresourcesforeducation Let me know if this is makes sense, or we should connect for more info. Thanks, Sebastian",,,,,,,,

9054,1986855053,256,"Hi David, For your quick question The spray does not at all affect the feel of the touch screen or any other part of the phone. It leaves no residue, and keeps the surface at the same friction level as it was before applying. If you look at other products out there, some leave a milky film, causing there to be unwanted tint in your device as well as creating a surface with more friction. There is no way to undo the treatment as of yet. 1. Where is the easy application video mentioned in the home page The video is not out yet we will not be providing the application video because the process is patent pending. However, the video link will provided to all backers when the product is shipped. 2. What is the proper method When used properly, Impervious leaves no sign of residue and When properly applied to both the internal and external components. What happens if it is improperly applied can it damage iPhone The proper method will be disclosed upon the arrival of your purchase. What I can tell you is that improper application consists of spraying too much on one area letting it dry like that could create an uneven layer, but this can be prevented by using the applicator pad and distributing out the product on the device. It is important that while you are applying our product, if you have any questions to contact us with them. 3. Fully treating your device requires that you take off your screen Does this mean the actual front cover of the iPhone or the screen protector Reading in between lines, it appears that we have to remove the iPhone screen for complete protection. However, the main video says and shows  Imperious is applied by simply spraying the OUTER components. So what is the truth  Fully treating the device requires you removing the actual cover of the iPhone which is the screen. The spraying the outer components refers to the water resistant package, starting at 29. Taking off your screen is only necessary for the full waterproofing treatment, starting at 39. 4. What is the capacity of the bottle How many cc is needed for Full protection for each application What is the shelflife of the bottle The bottle is 8 ml. It contains enough for about two 2 full applications. The product will last about three 3 years. 5. What exactly is the tool kit It appears that you need different tool kits for different iPhone models. If so, then it appears that we need to keep purchasing the tool kits every year as I upgrade my iPhone yearly!! Thanks The tool kit is a collection of the tools necessary to take apart your phone and properly apply Impervious. The kit will work for all iPhones. If a new phone comes out that does not work with the kit we have provided, we will begin providing a new one for the new generation. This being said most of the newer iPhones use the same tools the phones just differ in the application due to new components. We hope to have addressed all of your questions, if you need any more clarification please feel free to contact us. Thanks for your support! The Impervious Crew.",,,,,,,,

9120,2016815083,4,"I posted this is the wrong place initially, I think. I got mine a few days ago, but only had time to try it out today. My 1st rocket I made without watching the video, and didnt reinforce the tube or the compression cap. At 50psi, it exploded on launch, attaining a total altitude of maybe 20ft. the entire top of the rocket had torn apart and was unsalvageable. The 2nd rocket I built after watching the video. I used ducttape over the cap, and from the fins up to the tip of the nosecone. I didnt add reinforcing tape around the tube near the fins as it would cover up the dotted lines. this one launched well, attaining maybe 150ft again 50psi and ran into some trees on the way down, slowing the descent. On recovery, I found the tube had ruptured where the fins attach, mangling one of the fins. As the rocket was otherwise pristine, I took off the fins, repaired the tube, and wrapped the lower section of the tube with clear packing tape. I then put on new fins, and covered them with duct tape. The 3rd launch again 50psi went maybe 200ft up, and returned unimpeded to bury itself in the ground. the nose cone was a bit beatup but still held its shape, and the rest of the rocket was fine. So I guess the paper rockets should really be described as ducttape rockets, and I really recommend watching the video. When building if you think youve taped enough...add a bit more just in case. Anyhow, this toy is incredibly fun. I cant wait to try it out at 80psi. Ill need to build a couple more rockets in the mean time. Lastly, the instructions mention getting further instructions at the link httpwww.outloudimaginations.comHOWTOBUILDAROCKET But this link doesnt actually exist at this time.",,,,,,,,

Our first rocket launch was spectacular! Pumped to about 30psi and damn did that thing fly. It came down right in the middle of the yard and stuck into the dirt about a 12 inch didnt expect that. We were able to get about 6 more launches until the bottom of the rocket blew out. For the next rocket Ill reinforce the lower section before attaching the fins. Thanks Nathan. Well done!

For example, scrolling marquee text that scrolls from left to right across one wheel to the next. Or an animation of a dog chasing a cat and then the cat turns around and hops to the other wheel smacking the dog or whatever. At a bare minimum, having the two wheels be able to sync to the SAME display playing the same exact frame on each wheel simultaneously would be a start. Hope that makes sense.

Did finally get it out, but a little extra space there would have been useful. I dont expect to use this in most circumstances.

9216,2048780172,126,"It makes since that the creators would target iOS for their companion App. Now dont take this the wrong way, I do not want to start any wars here about which is best. There are all great. I have 7 android devices and 10 window devices and it looks like I have reason to pick up a used iPad now. Here is the reason developers like to develop software for iOS devices It is a controlled environment. Very little compatibility problems, if it runs on on the first generation device it will run on all the devices. Android is a completely different animal. It is open source, it runs on many different platforms, and has been modified my many different companies to support their feature set. That means there are compatibility issues with apps across different platforms. What runs on one android device may not run on another. All on has to do is read the comments on a app in the app store and you will see that an update that fixes an compatibility issue on one device breaks it on other devices. This is is especially true of more demanding apps like the companion Artiphon app. I am not saying that it could not be developed to run on most of the backers more powerful android devices. What I am saying is that it is easier to develop for iOS first, then develop for the more powerful android devices. I also would like to see that happen.

9295,2070069709,2,"Hi Stephan  Thanks so much for your inquiry. As youre likely aware, weve done our very best to be transparent from the beginning with our Kickstarter updates  whenever we learn something, our backers are the first to know. We knew the development of something so new and innovative would come with some challenges and obstacles, but were very confident well eventually have the MagnoPlug in the hands of our loyal backers and in store shelves! At the onset, we were hoping our schedule would go as planned, but the safety standard process has been much more complicated than even they predicted seeing as were rewriting the law that governs all electrical plugs as we know it. Its cool to know were all Kickstarting something so groundbreaking, however it does require a little more patience from all of us. All we can do at this moment is continue to work hard to develop the MagnoPlug. Were fully committed to having it ready for the public as fast as possible and at this time were hoping the latest that will be is the fall of 2015. We assure you that our commitment to you, our backers, is one of our fiercest motivators. MagnoPlug has and will always adhere to Kickstarters rules and regulations and were excited to be able to share the creation and development of this groundbreaking product with all of you.  The MagnoPlug Team",,,,,,,,

9310,2074397407,11," Markus Laire Currently the Burden Voltage is 40mVA or 40uVmA. This may be subject to change before release as we have created a new sensing front end using a higher sampling resolution and havent finalised the value of current shunt to be implemented in the manufactured version. The load power monitoring facility is somewhat independent of Burden Voltage as the reference voltage node is monitored after the highside shunt therefore taking the voltage applied to the USB device or more specifically the USB connector if USB cable resistance is to be taken into account. Moving forward, we only hope to improve our design before shipment to our backers.",,,,,,,,
9311,2074397407,14, Markus Laire We are in the process of optimising the code for lower power and have just updated the ARM processor for DMA capability but havent yet characterised the new microcontrollers power usage at every sampling rate.

9312,2074397407,16," Markus Laire Hi Markus. The Arduino library will be released as open source under a GNU GPL license which is less restrictive than the desktop software, that will always be free but not open source. The Arduino library will be available via a public GIT repository by the time the LogIT hardware is shipped. If you wish to power the LogIT from and external source the debug port can power the system even when the battery is removed. The battery can be unplugged if required.",,,,,,,,

9314,2074397407,18,"We have a few alternatives to 3D printing open to us including a lower volume moulding process which would meet the needs of a smaller batch run. Tekt also has a 150W laser cutter which would be able to make an alternate case purely from perspexacrylic. Some of the internal casing is already made via this process. While 3D printing is not ideal, there is very little in the way of budget for more expensive casing manufacture processes. Ideally, the casing will be moulded but a laser cut case would be the best alternative.

I think that the rapid proliferation of smartwatches, especially from Apple and Pebble, will significantly erode the market for this device, and the creators probably see that writing on the wall.

9345,2081896228,21,"The minimum force detectable using the thicker easier to work with aluminum foil included in the kit and using the constantvoltage measurement method shown is about 50 grams. However, if thinner aluminum foil is used for the electrodes and alternative measurement methods are used, the minimum detectable force can decrease to 5 grams or less. The thinner aluminum foil is easy to obtain in any grocery store, and the next best alternate measurement method is to simply use a higher voltage for the constantvoltage method, such as a 9V battery instead of the 5V supply from the Arduino. For even better minimum force detection and higher force resolution, a simple currenttovoltage converting opamp can be used. Many alternative circuits and sensor construction methods will soon be posted on our new website which will be going live next week  it is www.sensorfilmkit.com.

While it is easy for us to offer the sensor film itself in many different sizes, or even rolls of widths up to 24 wide by many feet long, it becomes difficult to offer the aluminum foil and adhesivebacked protective outer layer components in lots of different sizes. Right now we are thinking of perhaps offering 3 sizes of the kit, with the 4 by 6 being the small size, a 12 x 12 medium sized kit, and large kit probably shipped in rolls of 2 feet by 3 feet.

9411,2104479162,0,Apologies for not posting this before but I have been away. Whilst I have been very critical of AIO Robotics on here and I still feel that a lot of that criticism is warranted I also want to be fair and from the other comments on here it would seem that I was probably the only one who didnt get a shipping note in October. If that is the case then AIO would have started selling via Amazon etc after giving everyone else but unlucky me the opportunity to have their Zeus delivered. That means that I was probably wrong to give AIO such a hard time about their business practices so apologies to Jens and the team. It seems I have just been unlucky. Im still shocked that people have left their expensive machines on the shelf that long but each to their own and I guess what is a lot of money to some people isnt to others. I have been checking the Forum but there only seem to have been 9 posts in total so I am guessing that things must go pretty smoothly once the machine arrives.

Re. the last 6 remaining GPIO since theres so few unused connections, Id be in favour of breaking these out directly on the VGA666 PCB. It saves space, reduces the number of components needed, and avoid any potential for conflict with the occupied GPIOs.",,,,,,,,
9438,2109415863,30," Bernard  the only free GPIO are GPIO 2227 BCM not physical pins and the two HAT pins physical pins 27 and 28 on B The 6 bits per colour channel means you get a maximum of 262144 colours. If you read the documentation that Gert has posted on GitHub it says the following At the highest resolution the pixel quality is almost as good as HDMI. If you look very closely there is a slight pixel crawl. The adapter uses a simple resistor ladder network as digitaltoanalogue converter. Therefore the colour quality depends on how well balanced your resistors are. The video shown uses an adapter with 1 SMD resistors. There is a slight colour banding and with 6 bits per channel you have a maximum of 262144 colours.

My car gives me instantaneous feedback on litres  100km  just like GoFar. Its not very actionable though. It shoots up if I go up a hill for example, but what can I do The RAY on the other hand is calculating my efficiency is as good as it can be and so there may be a way to drive up a hill efficiently and keep it in the blue. So I find GoFar more actionable  its not just providing data, its providing relevant guidance. 2. Perhaps more important to me, is that my car never remembers anything. Its like a goldfish with a 3 second memory. GoFar though is logging data for you. This means you can then get more insights from that information  its not just shown and then gone as it is in your car.",,,,,,,,

Its a question of if we increase the battery comparment size life doesnt linearly go up with battery mass, but the vehicle will fly longer with more battery. Its plausible that the vehicle top could be changed so a wider range of battery size options could be given. Were going to have think about how we would do that without making the vehicle appearance to topheavy. Bart and Jeff We were looking into how we could add more options without making the number of pledge levels confusing. Weve seen before where campaigns have said message us the number of extra pieces you want and add that to the donation. Does that seem the best way of going or would you rather see us add more levels Pascal I hope were turning the tide with the fish swarm. Things are definitely trend set. In terms of response, were committed to staying communicative and getting updates out. Weve gotten some great engagement with the media  just need more of it!

The drone is already controllable by midlevel processor via an RC transmitter  the specific receiver or satelite receiver would just need pluging into the port on the midlevel controller board. It currently supports various serial sbus, ibus and DSM formats  so Futaba, Flysky, Spektrum are ready to go. One thing that was mentioned earlier is that in this more traditional drone mode, the video can also come down over a standard Boscamlike 5.8GHz analog link  we were just thinking on whether to add this transmitter by default weight, parts cost, power when running or just make it addable.",,,,,,,,
9468,2115832197,64,"Hi Polyhelo, I have a few questions how does cmi land Does it return to the app GPS coordinates and does it measure heigthdistance to the ground  Will the shot features increase E.g. a leader perspective, or custom settings distance, angle of already existing modes Thanks in advance!",,,,,,,,
9469,2115832197,31,"Heri, I think one of the bigger picture aspects for Polyhelo is that we dont really envision a single drone form that gets all the pieces right. Cmi has many core elements that are relevant to a wider range of vehicle fuselages  and the fuselages are actually some of the easier pieces to change. The core of Cmi is the integrated vehicle  camera control system and the associated web of communications between the flyerfliers, the tabletphones and the dedicated GPS trackers. We packaged that with a nice protected camera and legs that could detach so the whole vehicle could easily go in a pack pack with a minimum of annoyance for assembly  disassembly. But funding out Cmi does 70 of the work needed for packaging the brains in a different form. Maybe a followon model thats larger and can carry a prograde camera for much longer or maybe thats a waterproof drone  both are easy. I guess I would say, back us to get the internals right and get a machine really working properly, and well absolutely promise to start offering it in different form factors. We already have a tiny ducted fan format that were ready to go with. Its no substitute for cmi in quality image collection or lifetime of flight, but it can do really close in photography and you can interact with it without danger to your hands. This is all tools for jobs and not trying to treat all jobs as needing a hammer because the only tool you have is a hammer  Im also looking forward to starting new campaigns and hopefully, eventually just launching product lines that get to different parts of the increasingly wide range of consumer demands. But Cmi remains the best, most focused drone on just getting the aerial photography right from start to finish, gimmick free.",,,,,,,,

Weve had a few questions on this topic and we will be posting an update soon  stay tuned!",,,,,,,,
9514,2121935773,11,"Dave Joubert Hey Dave, I assume youre referring to experiments around other methods of generating circuit boards with a hobby machine If thats what youre focussing on, Im more than happy to share a whole slew of experiments and thoughts on the topic because Im well acquainted with the whole development process we took on and have actually written a thesis paper on the topic of generating low cost circuits onto paper substrates. If I find theres enough of a want for it in our community Id be happy to write a more detailed account of some of the processes but in the meantime, I can answer any specific questions you might have. In terms of the Circuit Scribe paired with a CNC plotter  the short answer is that it could potentially work for very relatively low resolution craft applications but it would fall down in terms of precision, ability to solder and reliability. Most of these are probably kind of selfexplanatory but Ill briefly note down some points here. Dont get me wrong  we love the Circuit Scribe, its a totally awesome product weve been following since before the Kickstarter, its just catering to a different market than the EX. So the precision problem comes from the minimum tip width of the pen and how it will vary with minor bumps in the surface of the substrate material. This would obviously just limit what size of components you can attach to and is why they also sell the breakout boards with magnet attachments. Additionally flexure in the pen tip during corners, ink flow inconsistencies and other things make the pen perfectly suited to hand drawing but not well suited to automated processes. Next, the ink used in the Circuit Scribe is based upon now my chemistry is a little rusty so dont quote me here on what appears to be a Silver colloidal structure. This basically means that there are microscopic Silver particles embedded in the structure of the ink that allow for conductance. Conversely, having a two part precipitation process such as with the EX allows for larger Silver particles to be generated on the substrate. This is what we ultimately believe to be the defining factor in allowing for solder flow across tracks. This is obviously very important for assembling any designs above very simple craft based circuits. Lastly, the ink flow from the pen would not be 100 reliable  obviously the Circuit Scribe is infinitely better than previous designs of conductive pens but even a split second of inconsistent flow would leave an insulative gap in your trace. Again this isnt a problem if youre drawing it by hand but automation becomes less viable. A final point on the reliability is that a CNC controlled pen is required to physically press against youre substrate which increases your chance of shifting or creasing your substrate. If its more of experiments on actual devices made with the EX youre interested in  were certainly planning on starting a blog as soon as the Kickstarter ends following our exploits of testing as many things as possible.

One of the auto calibration videos shows the speed being adjusted on the fly with the knob on the control panel. It gets fairly speedy. James T S, You have a lot of questions. I found out about this project a few weeks ago in the google group for delta 3d printers. I backed this morning, and am very excited. Let me see if I can help a bit. 1. They can have the early shipping estimates on the early birds because they have already started working on them. If you look at the time frame chart, you can see that they have parts already ordered. 2. Costs are low because they arent steeply raising the prices. This seems fair to me if I were to purchase all the parts separately like I had been planning on. Also, they have a laser cutter, so they can cut the acrylic in house now if I can just convince them to but mine in blue. 3. Electronics Arduino Mega 2560 with the RAMPS shield. Hardware Aluminum extrusion and acrylic. I believe all of it is described in different parts in the KS. I will say, it is probably the prettiest Kossel I have seen outside of one of the Kossel Pros I saw at Metrix in Seattle. 4. Time frame I think was answered already. 5. Early bird doesnt have testing on it because none of the early birds are assembled, they are all kits. The only ones that mention being tested are the ones that are fully assembled. Me, I want to build mine, so I went for an Early Bird kit. 6. I have no idea on the instructions, etc.. I know on their website they had some beta testers do the build. If you go to the site, you can see some pics and video from it. The point was to have people who never built a 3d printer before, build one. From what I can gather, it looks like it was a success.

9585,2132074309,46,"Craig, Thank you! Honestly, you do not need to go out and buy something special. But amazon links are a great idea. I will look up some links and pass them on. In the mean time, I think we got the little double sided one for making eggs at Bed Bath and Beyond. The kettle from a camping supply store. All the rest are just our regular household pots. This are the specs that are in the written part of the project The stove top allows you to use small and medium household lidded pots and pans preferably black in color or as dark as possible. Does not require special containers or heat resistant bags. The recommended maximum capacity is 3 lbs. The recommended pot or pan should not exceed 8 diameter.  Hope this helps, I will post some links soon. Thank again for the support!",,,,,,,,
9586,2132074309,37,"creator The Sun Juicer is a worthy project. Ive always been fascinated by the possibility of harnessing solar energy. Many years ago I started constructing a 8 long parabolic cylnder with a pipe at the focal point and a water pump for heating a pool. I never finished due to a lack of mechanical and engineering talent. Your project got me surfing Amazon and Google on parabolic mirrors, solar ovens, and fresnel lenses. There are a few finished products at a higher price point than yours. Your project, however, brings simplicity, portability, and value to the market. Im envisioning a simple distilation vessel for creating potable water would be a great accessory.",,,,,,,,

Any chance you can describe if Minibloq is usable on all arduino platforms Your recent update added the Seeeduino, so are you just having to test other boards to ensure compatibility For example I have the Arduino Mega 2560 Micro controller. Do you have a list of Compatible boards If u have a list I missed it sorry. Does Minibloq use the existing libraries from the Arduino web site thus compatible with Insert random part here example a 8 Segment LED etc. Keep up the great work, I think the community of Arduino beginners and experts will benefit greatly with all the hard work your doing.

9630,2144961863,70,"You can see details of how the mesh routes from the SimpleMesh User Guide linked from the main Kickstarter, page 8 onward. Neighbours are discovered using broadcasts  and there is no master route table needed, nodes only need to know a little bit of information nexthop. The protocol is very minimal so tries to keep traffic down  more complex mesh networks often fail because they are too chatty for large networks. As part of functional testing of nodes, we hope to set up a large network to see how it really performs. So there is no designed edgetoedge limit, it will depend a little on topology and how often your nodes are sending data. The radio chip we choose comes in a 900 MHz variant, and is almost pincompatible. The RF layout would need to change though, so its not a direct replacement. As such we dont have immediate plans for a 900 MHz version, but once the 2.4 GHz versions are going we may investigate this. Theres a fair amount of work involved in testing the new antenna design  getting the required approvals to legally sell them. Hope you enjoy the RadioBlock!

9635,2145095598,122,"Tom, the boards dont need to be stuffed with all the components. One can designin a number of subsystems and only stuff certain configurations. Ive done this countless times. A corner or whatever of the board could have an area for gyroaccelgps and simply not be stuffed. Thats why I suggested a pro version. This would include the components I suggested. I realize that one cant please everyone. The minimal nonspecific configuration would work for everyone through the addition of external addon boards. Id put a lot of thought into the layout and connector selection in order to make the integration of submodules easier. I can see designing a board that simply plugs on top of this one that has the custom hardware. . For that to happen the connectors have to be arranged in a rectangular patter around the periphery. They also have to be of equal height and interface with a readily available part for interconnection. To that end, move the Reset button off to a corner of the board so that it will not be obscured if another board is plugged on top of the freeSoC. The same is true of any LEDs that should remain visible. The only other request Id have is to do something better for the power entry connector. A 0.1in header will make it difficult to maintain reliable power to the board. For example, a potential application being robotics, it would be important to ensure that power to the board is solid and stable. IO can be customized through a daughtercard, but power should be solid and stable, which means that a good connector is a must. Again, one could very well argue that if this is important it could also go on the daughetercard. Just offering constructive feedback. My main interest in this is in teaching my kid some embedded programming.",,,,,,,,

9653,2146528892,21,"Hey Sean, What Im hearing is 2 things One, that you want the design of the case to have more volume to accommodate phones with cases, like yours. Thats something Id like to improve upon for the next design. Im already working with an amazing new designer to improve this. And the second is that the Size Calculators UI needs to be clarified. I think itd be a good idea to clarify the casesize issue, as you pointed out. There are thousands of combinations of phones and cases and the 2 now 3 OFF Pocket sizes simply cant fit them all. Ill be making improvements to the interface so its easier to see what does and doesnt fit. I think an interactive graphicanimation of the sizes would help here.
