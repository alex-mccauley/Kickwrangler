Right now, we dont have an engineer in place to build out that feature, so well be building the custom graphics manually for supporters who back at those levels.

As the months go on, theyll be understanding more and more of the harder apps and hopefully revisiting some of the harder apps of their first months. But, youre definitely right it WILL be necessary to create some kind of a Level 2 box to which kids can graduate when theyre ready. This will probably omit easy apps and begin to introduce more raw Javascript.

As I promised, I am posting about the special Kick Starter color. This was a very difficult decision. I am an artist, so my love of colors goes without saying. Honestly, I kept arguing the point for all the colors. However, Tony being the practical one, informed me that we had to run 1,000 of whatever color we chose and choosing more than one was financially out of the question. Of course I was disappointed, but put my business hat on and sat down to tally all the votes, private messages and comments. I thought that the color should be a commemoration of the Kick Starter nature of our companys launch and a special reminder for all our gracious backers of your role in a successful Kick Starter project. Soo.... drum roll please The special KickStarter color will be KICK STARTER GREEN I hope that I havent disappointed too many of you and I fought hard for adding two colors. I promise it wont be an obnoxious green. It is a fun green. So, I will be sending out your surveys to select Black, White or Kick Starter Green Expedition Only later this morning. Tony leaves for China in 16 hours so we hope we have a good idea of the mix of color choices by the time he lands. Again, Thank you so much for all your support!

3HA5ODM5KASD6PXN08DGXUDU58AVST,648,665,"Thanks guys. Justin Rand  we couldnt agree more with your thoughts on stress. And Vincent we are currently developing the firmware for the new board, which will govern the functional limitations of the API  so its coming! but please be patient. I am really sorry that we have been so short on updates but all the work weve been doing is engineering work  and most backers just dont care about this information. But since you guys ARE interested heres brief taste on the latest in iWinks labs for the techminded We have had the circuit upgrade prototyped and working on our breadboards for some time and have now switched over to developing that proof of concept in PCB form. The new boards have already been printed and assembled and we are just awaiting the arrival of some lab equipment to get these suckers programmed, test signal quality, test our algorithms, etc. on that new hardware. This is much more difficult to do on the PCB than on the breadboard. We want to be sure that this design will take us where we need to go before we go running our mouth about it! Of course as soon as we confirm all of these items are where they need to be you can expect an update! And again this is holding back much of manufacturing so it is still hard to estimate our ship date until this happens. We have made progress on manufacturing the EEG sensors but some drawbacks have left us with a great concept which is only halfway implemented at the moment. We have been very busy and we just need to complete our due diligence. We promise to share more as soon as we have a little more concrete information.

3GVPRXWRPHUM1LTVDYGMNER4AS1I7W,190,51,"Wishing all of you a Happy Thanksgiving Holiday Weekend! Robert  short answer is yes  Sofft works very well with dress shirts in terms of ironing and providing a professional finish. The process we used to obtain the professional finish is detailed below. We washed dress shirts using a liquid detergent, introduced starch in the rinse cycle of a front loading washing machine and then immersed the clean clothes in diluted Sofft for 10 minutes in a 5 gallon pail. The cleaners have programmable washing machines so that they can inject starch and Sofft sequentially into the washing machines.The shirts were then put back in the washer in the spindry cycle, dried and then ironed. After treating the clothes with Sofft, the ironing process is remarkably easier and it is also easier to obtain a more professional quality finish on dress shirts at home. Incidentally, this experiment was done with my friend who had his own dry cleaning shop for over 20 years. He was so impressed that he signed on to recruit his dry cleaner colleagues to offer Sofft treated shirts to their clients. When we do our laundry at home, there is not a straightforward way to introduce both starch and Sofft into the washing machine at this time on front loading washing machines. Please let us know how you plan to use Sofft to treat your dress shirts.",208457577,A1PE0077HI218F,0,A1T79J0XQXDDGC,0,A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW,1,A3UWM3KJYEL5XU,1,A9K0CV70JWG1W,1,0.6,2015-06-15 08:41:02 UTC

We have now talked to several different airline companies and none of the ones we have spoken to or traveled with have said that the PRO DRYBAG 45L is too large to bring as a carryon luggage and when it comes to the Shockproof Inflatable System it is no safety restrictions to bring it on board airplanes. Inside Mesh pocket The Shockproof Inflatable System is designed to not only protect your gear but also to hold your gear in place and in combination with the ergonomic fit thanks to the airtight zipper it will prevent the PRO DRYBAG 45L from move around when traveling in rocky terrain or at high speed.

3XUSYT70IT1RBZDP0LU2H214A9ND0P,81,53,"I come from a long career in data processing before it was called IT in the financial services industry. In my early years I programmed in six different languages and after getting into management I enjoyed using a TRS80 and IBM PC to write BASIC programs just for fun. There was always something special to me about a computer that would just boot up ready to use BASIC. And that is what Chuck Hellebuyck makes available to everyone again with this project a small, selfcontained, and ready to use i.e. no soldering computer that runs the MMBASIC interpreter which is very close to Microsoft BASIC GWBASIC that ran on my TRS80. IMO, the BASIC programming language, unlike the C language variants, uses a strait forward syntax that is easy to work with and is a great way to learn programming. It should also be noted that the Maximite board design interfaces with Arduino shields so it can be used to learn about this common microcontroller platform that is used in robotics and to drive 3D printers. I hope my comments help you decide to back this project to meet its goal and much more so we all have access to a dedicated BASIC computer again.",81023186,A1PE0077HI218F,1,A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW,0,A3HW4QDJB63OQ2,1,A9K0CV70JWG1W,0,AKJ8CNFZH73K6,0,0.4,2015-06-15 08:20:51 UTC

I followed the harvesting instructions, put the tube in at a 45 degree angle with just the lip out of the water and put the collection cloth you provided on the end, secured with the rubber band  so far so good  but then the collection cloth inflated like a balloon and no waterspirulina wouldcould come out of the tube. I loosened the rubber band a bit thinking maybe it was too tight, but then I just got bubbles coming out from below the water line where the cloth was secured to the tube.

3GL25Y6843U2CJPDGQIC96B9TUZXML,619,90,"Hi Everyone, Great discussion, I wanted to respond to some of the comments. The Bluetooth is 3.0, rather than Bluetooth low energy BTLE. This was a deliberate design choice! The main reason is that Bluetooth 3.0 supports the serial port profile SPP  your computer mac, pc, etc. just sees it is a serial port, with nothing to install or special interfaces. This is the type of behavior people tend to expect from Arduino, BTW  its basically just a wireless version of the USBtoserial that Arduino has been using for years. The other reason is speed. BT 3.0 his a higher overall data throughput that BTLE, by a fair amount. Since the whole ethos behind what we were doing with the Atto was to bring more processing power to the platform, the BT 3.0 seemed a better match. Okay, the other question thats been going around is the question of flashing by USB. Admittedly, we werent thinking of this as something that people would want, but it indeed seems to be important to some, who just want a wired connection. So, were now working on a breakout that will let you select USB for power  flashing, which will make the board function a little more traditionally. The tricky part is making the USB play nice with the Bluetooth, and keeping things simple and straightforward for the user. So, well be working on this circuit solution and associated board, and keep everyone posted. Thanks again for all the support!

If hulu specificly is your primary use you might want to wait until we get that feature working. 2 We will allow video through the servers. 3 Kickstarters will receive unlimited bandwidth as long as they own their SurfEasy key. When we launch the product commercially there will be a service fee tied to bandwidth. We will treat kickstarters the same as post launch customers in terms of bandwidth  no artificial throttling and that type of stuff.

The FW function might work for you as well but if a show stopping problem does pop up we can only support it if you send it back on your dime.

32TMVRKDGNYWTSZZ2E6O7DDGGU684U,535,18,Hi. On the Arduino shield the headers around the edge of the board can either be stackable or nonstackable. Nonstackable are simply header pins which will connect the shield to the Arduino. Stackable headers also connect the shield to the Arduino but also allow you to add another shield on top or easily access the other Arduino pins. Stackable headers are the ones you have already in your base Arduino!

I would love to see when checklists and more features are available like custom categories morning specific tasks, night tasks. Also when choosing how a taskhabit repeats itself Like setting the specific time of the day it may have to be completed by. Or inversely, that it must be complete or not complete, ie quitting cigarettes within a certain amount of days, weeks, or months a certain amount times it may have to be completed in that time frame. In my opinion, these kinds of features would effectively replace the necessity to use most of the other 3rd party apps.

It also has a USB port for initially setting up the WiFi connection and for powering the device. We just werent counting on people using the base version for any custom work. I guess you could access the base version via the REST web service interface to get basic sensor data and alarms. Once again we werent planning on documenting that. The base version does not have the raspberry pi so it does not run apache, it does have an httpd server but with limited memory and computing power. Most of the dashboard code is in javascript and JQuery libraries and can be server from our web site, so the internal httpd server on the base version is just sending the page framework and the data stream. Why dont you tell me what you have in mind to do. Maybe I can be more specific then. I think you could probably do ok working with the base if you could use the REST api but the Pro version is set up to make that a lot easier and we are going to supply some code to get you started etc. Ill do what I can to work with you .",591103944,A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW,0,A1ZFUBB7KVAT4G,0,A3HW4QDJB63OQ2,0,A9K0CV70JWG1W,0,AKJ8CNFZH73K6,0,0,2015-06-15 08:58:35 UTC

Is Make!Sense mini works with Scratch, Processing, and other programs Mini works with Processing but not Scratch at this time, though we are working on it. I think Max is your better bet. 2. Is there any syllabus or training manual that comes with all the rewards tier If not, could you specify which one dont have In physical book or pdfs Manuals, videos and instructables are coming, this is the reason we are asking for Kickstarter money because as you can see we already have the boards finished and ready to ship. 3. Can Make!Sense maxmini works portable or it must always tether to a laptopcomputer Mini clips into your tablet or phone in the microphone jack, so its not tethered to the computer, but rather plugged into the phone or tablet. 4. Is that many Make!Sense boards necessary in Constructionist Bundle How about a tier with the most minimum Make!Sense boards as needed in accompany training manuals with all sensors We can probably arrange to make a special deal for you with fewer boards and more sensors, but right now the Kickstarter Rewards are fixed. 5. Is Make!Sense use proprietary sensors Or, I can use any off the shelf sensors such as those from generic Arduino kits Off the shelf sensors are fine, but my current boards only function with analog sensors resistance, voltage not digital sensors that send coded data in a data stream. There are plenty of analog sensors to choose from, and I will bundle some nice ones for you. Thanks so much for your interest.

3VMHWJRYHVGW69XWU3EZEGR0WTNXFE,145,3,"QuestionsSuggestions 1. Amazon  I believe that like many products that claim to be great which being optimistic I believe yours will be it really isnt known for sure until you check the Amazon reviews. Do you plan on setting up shop like many other KS creators and using that as a platform to market this as well as future products and accessories to the masses because again assuming all goes well with this Ill be sure to write a review. Also considering US backers use Amazon to checkout on KS thus indicating they have an account, establishing yourself there would be a good idea, no Another reason is because as Im sure like other backers so many products nowadays want us to sign up for another site that avoiding to have to remember another username and password would be greatly appreciated. 2. Official Return Policy andor Warranty Manufacturers or otherwise  Could you specify in detail exactly what your warranty covers and what it does not as well as outline your return policy if any also going into detail of the processes involved in both cases ex we pay for shipping back or you do etc..., thanks. 3. Material  So this is made out of what material exactly and please dont say metal, a detailed a response as possible is ideal even where sourced from would be helpful. ATTRACT BACKERS 4. Early Bird adopter Specials  KS backers kill for them, and depending on what your budget would allow for because then if done even better some campaigns introduce or actually start with Super Early Bird offers than Early than Midday KS offer below retail. Some add names unique to their own campaign, such as early thiefs idk seeing how their getting in before the you get the idea. FILL YOUR PAGE 5. Stretch Goals  Too late now of course but for future projects Id recommend featuring accolades as well as stretch goals more prominently so as to let potential backers know how well you are already doing andor with plans on a improved product or benefits to compel them to jump on board despite some of the better perks being eaten up already. Ex This project is Dragon Certified which no doubt not for this project but for next perhaps assuming this is successful andor featured in articles on Engadget for example. Considering you dont have the accolades featured obviously Id consider especially since being closer to the finish line placing greater emphasis on the stretch goals. KEEP BACKERS 6. Updates  Will you continue to update your backers updates on current projects, future projects, others questions answered etc through KS comment section, update section, direct message andor email after campaign ends KS is ideal 7. ContactSupport  What are the different ways to contact you after the campaign ends Aside from a website In case of problems etc, it would be in your interest to keep communicating on KS not only with direct messages but comment section questions so that the community can see perhaps answers to questions they hadnt even thought of. Some companies have a number andor email as well. ATTRACT BACKERS 8. Sister Campaign  I suggest trying if you havent already to contact other projects with a similar focus to ultimately create a sister campaign with as others such as Yoropen has done with swivelCard as one example to try garner support from an additional channel though this being so late probably wont be for this campaign but next maybe. 9. Security  Is this device tamper proof from the outside or are their ways a would be thief with time could eliminate the purpose of this device or is it relatively unless they break the door solid in its concept ATTRACT BACKERS 10. ThunderClap  I believe this is a tool LinkMount By the way that is the perfect example of what a Kickstarter campaign is in almost every aspect so study it among others have used to garner support so please research it as well if you havent so you could use it to help. 11. IndieGoGo  I would recommend you be open if you will or have ever operated on another crowdfunding site because if found out many will begin to distrust you not mentioning earlier especially if no good answer is provided why you are relaunching here. 12. Future Discount  For your backers relative to other kickstarter projects some creators like those of the Blink campaign as just one example have made their backers if not generally which Id recommend at least for Earlybirds aware that they would have continued access to special promotions and discounts following the campaignwill you be offering anything similar for yours Like for your future projects like they have such as your v2 if you make one and accessories Also for upcoming releases will you also be contacting us early as well to put us on notice 13. Listing Image Update  Another GREAT way to further inform potential backers of info that might entice them to want to click on your listing such as other successful creators have done and you may have seen is update your main image with custom complimentary text updates within the main picture in addition to your already Staff pick add Listing ending in 3 days or 2 hours left or New stretch goals added or achievedunlocked or 85 accomlished or Earlybird offers dwindling or Additional Early bird offers now offered etcTrust me that will help. 14. Faulty Lock  How would you know if your device is faulty or defective in some way What signs to look out for other than clearly broken in pieces, loose parts noises etc 15. Privacy Policy and Backers Information  What exactly will you be doing with backers information Ex Giving it to 3rd parties or protecting it from them etc Also what is your privacy policy. 16. AddOns and Accessories  A carry bag for travel again that would be an idea for a stretch goal not now since your finished 17. Maintenance  Regarding proper care to maintain the ring for longevity, what would be recommended Special sprays, cleaners, updates, equipment in the form of tools, etcthose to use and avoid would be helpful I appreciate you taking the time to read all of these if you could and await your replies. This hopefully should help you.",149890531,A1T79J0XQXDDGC,0,A2RD843ESYKRP2,0,A3HW4QDJB63OQ2,0,A9K0CV70JWG1W,0,AQR70X1KIOP6B,0,0,2015-06-15 07:48:14 UTC

I could accidentally move a component, with the thermocouple, while the solder is still liquid. When I ran the fan full speed during the soak stages I was seeing a 6 degree difference in temp from left side to right side. With the fan staggered the difference was less than a degree. Running the fan full on when the heaters are full on helps eliminate hot spots.

3ACRLU860NEXNSUZUW2B71F81PLBE2,394,21,"Got my GLion a couple of weeks ago. Observations in no particular order 1 This is my second electric scooter, my first one is a MyWay. Since the MyWay cost me 1800, I wont make a direct 11 comparison. I will, however, use it as a reference. 2 The GLion is lighter than the MyWay, by about 5 kilos I would say. 3 Theyre both pretty simple with the folding  unfolding. 4 GLion could use more shock absorption  I literally rattle my teeth when going over any slight bump or dip. I understand the design idea behind using honeycombed tires rather than air, but an air tires option would provide at least some additional shock absorption. 5 The dimensions of the GLion make it easier to carry around than the MyWay. 6 I wish the GLion charging port was XLR instead of what it shipped with. I could have used the same charger for both scooters leave one at work, another at home. 7 I dont use the USB port. And on the one time I thought about using it, its location pretty much nixed the idea. 8 I dont recall if this was in the manual, but the brakes do NOT work when the motor is off. The MyWay has traditional brakes, front and rear. 9 Theres no rear reflector on the GLion, bit of an oversight imho. The MyWay has two. 10 Doesnt look like theres a secure way to lock up the GLion. 11 Possibly add some way to lock the handlebar into position when folded  this would make it easier to pull the folded scooter behind you a la roller luggage. Right now the handlebar freely moves so theres no way to keep the wheel straight when pulling. 12 Re brakes again  I find the handlebar twisttobrake system rather awkward, especially if youre a righty. Is there any way to incorporate both accel and braking into the right handlebar Would also facilitate oneortheother action. As in, if youre braking, you have to necessarily let go of the throttle. Or something similar. 13 Need a hook or mount or somesuch to hang a shopping bag on. Either on either side of the handlebar post or the front  rear of the post. 14 How much of a technical challenge would it be to have a smallish LED headlight embedded in the handlebar post Closer to the ground than the top This would work as both a daytime running light and convenient night time headlamp. It turns on when the motor is on. 15 Going back to the it only brakes when the motor is on  can a secondary braking system be added One that doesnt require the motor to be on I can foresee an unfortunate scenario wherein your juice runs out JUST as you need to brake. Not something Id like to happen to me. 16 Can the braking be regenerative Seems a waste of braking energy otherwise. 17 How much more expensive would an allaluminum frame version be 18 Carbon fibre model or parts options ",413104742,A1PE0077HI218F,0,A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW,0,A3HW4QDJB63OQ2,0,A9K0CV70JWG1W,0,AKJ8CNFZH73K6,0,0,2015-06-15 08:32:36 UTC

Update on Holiday Shipping December 17 2013 Hi Harald, Thank you so much for supporting us throughout our holiday season launch  we are so excited to get you your SOCCKETs! We are here for you and consider you an invaluable part of our mission. As members of our family, we wanted to share an honest update about our SOCCKET shipment status. In autumn, we placed an order to all of our vendors to supply us with materials to make your SOCCKETs for the holiday season. We paid in full for the materials and waited patiently in our newly set up assembly center in Newburgh, NY. Unfortunately, two of our 9 vendors experienced trouble getting us critical parts of the ball by the expected date  some as late as 3 weeks after our promised date. In addition, we have endured two snowstorms in the past four days, during a time when many deliveries were expected and delayed. The good news is that with the current snow tapering off, we will begin shipping SOCCKETs today. Our entire New York team has relocated to our manufacturing center in Newburgh, NY. We have been working for several days, without sleep, sparing no amount of time, energy or money to ensure that all of you will receive your orders in time for the holidays. All of us are personally building, packing and shipping your product. We are upgrading everyone to the fastest delivery possible, and will even hand deliver product if necessary! We are doing all that we can for you, our valued teammate. We hope that you will continue to be patient with us. Your support and enthusiasm over the past few months has been so valuable. You are the reason we exist. We will update you as soon as we can with further details. Please feel free to email us at anytime with questions and concerns. If we do not respond right away, please know it is only because we are on the floor of our factory, spending every minute of the day making your orders happen! Thank you so much, and Happy Holidays!

3Z33IC0JC0MV1A1OR2DPGZ84DKLV9I,885,53,"While it might be fine with the Kickstarter guidelines I havent read them, I must say that I agree with Paul Dutch. Personally, I dont oppose animal testing or using animals for genuine research, but I just dont think mutilating animals even cockroaches to play with is right, much less encouraging and enabling others to do so! If the funding was to do focused research involving the same technology, Id be fine with that, but this is just turning a live animal into a mutilated cyborg toy for commercial gain. It genuinely makes me feel sick in the stomach, and has very much changed my feelings towards Kickstarter as a whole. I wouldnt be able to sleep if I didnt say something. This isnt science at all. This is the equivalent of removing a flys wings to watch it wander hopelessly in frustration until it eventually dies, only in this case much more bizarre. Reiterating the fact that there is no proven painfear response is the equivalent of saying its ok to rape someone while theyre in a coma because they cant tell you to stop. I do have some respect for Kickstarters rules only because of the many brilliant projects they help fund and as such, I do not at this stage intend to withdraw my pledge I may change my mind, but Im not sure if I can withdraw it anyway. I feel as though the onlypledgerscancomment rule forces us to stand alone and face a wall of opposition when we really do have a lot of support in the wider community I would be surprised if the majority of people are comfortable with this type of product. I have read your page on ethics, which I find dances around the topic by way of either answering questions with statements that equate to it is neither proven nor disproven so therefore we are right or misrepresenting education as research. When I was at high school, in science class we were explicitly taught NOT to experiment on live animals. We performed dissections but this was on pieces of animals which had already been killed for other purposes meat. As somebody taught by the Australian public education system, I am deeply disturbed to hear that other institutions do not share these ethical concerns. If there is anything to be learnt from this kind of experimentation, why cant it be learnt once, in a lab, and reproduced only as necessary to validate or build on the results, rather than commercialised as a gimmick If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then where does the road made of aimlessly mutilated animals lead If this is not of ethical concern to Kickstarter, then what is In summary, I dont care what you do on what animals in your own lab, but using a medium like Kickstarter to aid and encourage others in the seemingly pointless mutilation of animals especially in the name of science is simply wrong, and I am completely opposed to this. PS I will also be lodging a complaint with Kickstarter itself. Also, for the record, I hate cockroaches, Im not doing this just for them but for the credibility of Kickstarter and the scientific and education communities, as well as out of fear of what might come next if this project is a success.",944294769,A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW,-2,A3HW4QDJB63OQ2,-1,A9K0CV70JWG1W,-1,AKJ8CNFZH73K6,0,AXMPSUNKUBEIL,-2,-1.2,2015-06-15 08:19:20 UTC

I always suspected that Paul Lizer didnt know what he was doing since the amount that he was looking for was way too low to be reasonable. Most hardware projects require a lot more money to get going but I decided to give Mr. Lizer and kickstarter the benefit of the doubt. I bet Kickstarter would have a lot more skeptical eyes if they were to label their which of their successful projects failed to deliver in the end, because those numbers are not insignificant. Mr. Lizer should just bite the bullet and tell everyone here the project is dead by posting an update. Others with failed projects have come and done this, and people have been accepting of this.

We changed this things and had to rework the hole enclosure process since this was done already. How ever we pushed our regular sales that does sale public WiFi here in Germany to finance the new enclosure topic. Currently we got the new LogoCI up and running and now reworking the enclosure for the beacons. We also now have running supportsystem that tracks everything very well. So please send us a mail to supportairfy.com if you want to receive the beacon without the enclosure right now. We know some people already did this e.g. Hitoshi and we will move it out within February since the PCB is already done and working.

Currently, there are no proven methods to stopping thieves if they want something bad enough, theyll find a way. However, here are some of the stuff we did to improve Sparks antitheft features 1.

A bike with no seat has been proven to deter theft more than a bike with a seat intact. 3. The tires are NOT quick release. The only way for a thief to steal your tire is with the aid of a tool.

3QI9WAYOGQBSRZIMZ058L2XVOFK6SE,330,321,James We will post to the FAQwebsite detailed post finishing instructions soon but resin handling is similar to other resins commercially available. Resins have zero VOC and minimal odor. We have taken great care to make it as safe as possible and will post a detailed MSDS soon after the campaign. You should wear gloves like handling any other common household chemicals. After printing you need to wash it to remove uncured resin. Rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol or Tripropylene Glycol Methyl Ether TPM are ok. TPM is preferred since it swells less and has less VOCsmell than rubbing alcohol but is harder to obtain. Material properties are similar to ABS and we will perform a detailed analysis by soon. The resin is carefully formulated to keep fine details while still being strong and not brittle to avoid cracking. It has enough flexibility that you can bend the staff in the red poseidon statue without breaking it not as brittle as say acrylic. The printed hollows spheres bounce without cracking. Ryan The Pegasus traces a laser in vector mode at 3000mmsec over the outlines so the speed of each layer depends on how many outlines it has. Takes around 5hrs to print an 8 Eiffel tower. Quality is very important to us so be sure to examine the details of our prints to be comparing apples to apples. We would never say anything about another product without having first hand experience so cant comment on the other printer.,347865310,A1T79J0XQXDDGC,0,A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW,0,A3HW4QDJB63OQ2,0,A3UWM3KJYEL5XU,-1,A9K0CV70JWG1W,0,-0.2,2015-06-15 08:41:38 UTC

Taking into account your claim that you are shipping to certain regions before others, are you prioritizing the backers in those regions who signed up for the Early Bird promotions Being one that was in the early categories, and living in a drought zone in the southern US, I would hope I wont be waiting too long before receiving my unit. One other question  how many units have actually shipped Based on the pictures you posted, it looks like a small fraction were packaged to ship.

3511RHPADVEY95LG7FB5KBAWS8ORLH,41,1,"Doug, Im sorry your unhappy. I have encountered a pretty serious shipping issue apparently. I shipped your girlfriends dock along with a bunch of other ones a month ago. Since I became aware of the problem, sadly your girlfriend isnt the only one that this happened too, I had to remake the five docks that went astray, new ones went out this morning. If your having an issue with the connection on your dock send it back to me and I will rewire it for you free of charge and send it back out to you the same day. If she doesnt get her dock by next Friday I will make another one and overnight it to you. Again I apologize for the delay.
